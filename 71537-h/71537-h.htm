<p class="ph2">INTRODUCTION.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> age in which we live seems remarkable for
its appreciation of men of renown, and for the
homage rendered to them. Societies that are
still in their youth are liable to be dazzled by
the superficial wonders of historical tradition,
and to allow their admiration to be easily taken
captive; but an epoch ripened by experience,
and by a long habit of literary criticism, should
rather reserve its enthusiasm for ascertained
facts, and for such deeds of renown as are beyond
the pale of doubt and discussion. Thus
we find in the present day a marked predilection,
not only as a matter of general utility
but also from a sense of justice, for a keen
research into every doubtful point of history.
Nations as well as individuals need the maturity
of time to appreciate at their real value
the actions and the traditions of past ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>The art of writing history has two very
distinct branches, the combination of which is
essential to the production of a complete historian.
A research into, and a criticism of,
events with no other aim than to elicit truth,
is one branch of the historical art; the other
is the resolution to interpret, to describe, to
give to each event its full signification and
colouring; to put that life into it in fact which
belongs to every human spectacle. It is only
the first part of the task that we propose to
undertake in these essays.</p>

<p>Seneca has said that we must not give too
ready credence to hearsay, for some disguise
the truth in order to deceive, and some because
they are themselves the victims of deception.
Other Greek and Latin writers have
also warned us against a too ready faith in
popular traditions. How many errors bequeathed
to us by the historians of antiquity
owe their enlarged growth, ere they reached
us, to their passage through the middle ages.</p>

<p>De Quincy tells us that if a saying has a
proverbial fame, the probability is that it was
never said. The same opinion may be held of a
great many so-called historical facts which are
perfectly familiar even to the ignorant, and
yet which never happened.</p>

<p>The French critic Lenglet du Fresnoy, in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
work “<i>L’Histoire justifiée contre les Romans</i>,” has
devoted about 100 pages to historical doubts;
but he only touches the surface of the subject.
Many years before Niebuhr, the Abbé Lancellotti
published at Venice in 1637, under the title of
“<i>Farfalloni degli antichi Storici</i>,” a curious volume,
now rare, in which he exposes the many absurd
stories taught in schools as history. The
book contains more than a hundred of these
fictions, and was translated into French by
T. Oliva 1770.</p>

<p>Du Pan, in his <i>Recherches sur les Américains</i>,
says that Montezuma sacrificed annually
twenty thousand children to the idols in the
temples of Mexico. In such assertions the improbability
and exaggeration are so self-evident
that it is needless to dwell upon them.</p>

<p>“Books,” says the Prince de Ligne, “tell us
that the Duke of Alba put to death by the
hands of the executioner in the Low Countries
eighteen thousand gentlemen, while the fact
is that scarcely two thousand could have been
altogether collected there.</p>

<p>Who is there who now believes in the story
of Dionysius the Tyrant becoming a schoolmaster
at Corinth?<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Even in the time of Titus Livius there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
so much doubt as to the truth of the legend
of the <i>Horatii</i> and the <i>Curiatii</i>, that he writes,
one cannot tell to which of the two contending
people the Horatii or the Curiatii<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> belonged.
Yet this cautious historian relates in another
place how Hannibal fed his soldiers on human
flesh to give them energy and courage. Mr.
Rey<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> has carefully studied the origin of the
heroic fable of the death of Regulus, and has
exposed its fallacy.</p>

<p>In comparatively modern times also, how
many delusions do we find worthy of ancient
history. The story of the Sicilian Vespers,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
for instance, and the episode concerning Doctor
Procida, who far from being a principal in the
massacre, was not even present at it. We may
also mention some of the anecdotes of Christopher
Columbus:<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the fable of the egg that
he is said to have broken, in order to make
it stand upright: the account of his anxiety,
amounting to agony, among his mutinous crew,
to whom he had faithfully promised a sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
of land—all of which has been disproved by
M. de Humboldt in his <i>Examen critique de
l’Histoire de la Géographie</i>.</p>

<p>The history of England also furnishes many
examples of similar credulity. Without entering
upon the murder of King Edward’s children,
which story has been discussed by Walpole,
may we not cite the death of the Duke of
Clarence, who for four centuries was believed to
have been drowned in a butt of Malmsey?—an
error exposed by John Bayley in “<i>The historic
Antiquities of the Tower of London</i>.”</p>

<p>We may cite again the often-mooted question
of the exhumation of the body of Cromwell,
and of the outrages committed on his remains
by order of Charles II:<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the interesting but
imaginative picture of Milton dictating Paradise
Lost to his daughters, while, if we may
believe Doctor Johnson, he never even allowed
them to learn to write. Modern historians,
however, are often equally incorrect. Among
them we may quote the poet laureate Southey,
who was guilty of a remarkable perversion of
facts regarding one of the wisest men of the
19th century.</p>

<p>In an article in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (Vol.
XXXIX. p. 477. April 1829) entitled, <i>State and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
Prospects of the Country</i>, we are told that
Conrad, a monk of Heresbach, had pronounced
in presence of an assembly, an anathema
against Greek, saying that: “a new
language had been discovered called Greek,
against which it was necessary to guard, as
this language engendered every species of
heresy; just as all they who learned Hebrew,
infallibly became Jews.”</p>

<p>This curious anecdote was repeated in <i>La
Revue Britannique</i>, No. 46. p. 254, whence it
found its way into a note of the <i>Poème de la
Typographie</i> of M. Pelletier (1 vol. 8ᵛᵒ. Genève,
1832) and the mistake was republished in
many other books. Now the real fact is, that
Conrad of Heresbach had never been a monk,
but was a confidential counsellor of the Duke
of Cleves, and that, far from prohibiting the
study of the ancient languages, he was one of
the savans of the 16th century who shewed
the greatest zeal in encouraging a taste for
their culture. It is he himself who, in order
to expose the ignorance of the clergy of that
period, relates, that he heard a monk from
the pulpit pronounce the anathema on the
Greek language which we have mentioned
above. So easy is it, by distorting facts, to
make or mar a reputation!</p>

<p>When we reflect on the innumerable errors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
daily propagated by books, we have cause to
be alarmed at the strange confusion in which
all literature may find itself a few centuries
hence. It is very possible that historical events
will be even more difficult of proof than before
the invention of printing, which may
consequently have served to augment disorder
and perplexity rather than to have assisted
in the promotion of truth and accuracy. In
a recent number of the <i>Constitutionnel</i>, in a
<i>feuilleton</i> supposed to be from the pen of M.
de Lamartine, it is stated that: “The tombs
of great poets inspire great passions. It was
at Tasso’s tomb,” he says, “that Petrarch, during
his first absence, nourished his regretful remembrance
of <i>Laura</i>!” Now Petrarch died in
1374, and it was more than two hundred
years afterwards (in 1581) that Tasso published
his first edition of the <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i>!</p>

<p>We should not know where to stop if we
attempted to bring forward examples of all
the improbable and the untrue in history. We
shall confine ourselves therefore to the examination
of a few of the most universally accredited
facts, the truth of which, to say the
least, is extremely doubtful.</p>

<p>We at one time entertained the project of
reconstructing the critical work of the Abbé
Lancelotti already mentioned, by enlarging its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
scope. This rare and scarcely known book
(<i>Farfalloni degli antichi Storici</i>) would have served
us as a basis, upon which we should have proceeded
to review history in general. It would
have been an instructive and a pleasant task
to demolish falsehood in order to arrive at
truth; to set aside, in good faith, worn out
platitudes, deeds of heroism resting on no
proof whatsoever, and crimes wanting the
confirmation of authenticity; but when we set
ourselves to estimate its extent, we shrank
from so laborious an undertaking.</p>

<p>In working out the subject, we should have
related, with Henry Schnitzler (<i>De la colonisation
de l’ancienne Grèce</i>), and with Schœll
(<i>la littérature grecque</i>), that <i>Cecrops</i> the Egyptian
had imposed upon us when he pretended to
come out of Egypt, as did <i>Cadmus</i> when he
professed to arrive from Phœnicia.</p>

<p>The Abbé Barthélemy (<i>Voyage du jeune
Anarcharsis</i>) would have enlightened us on
the memorable battle of <i>Thermopylæ</i>, where
<i>Leonidas</i>, instead of resisting the Persians with
three hundred men, commanded, according to
<i>Diodorus</i>, at least seven thousand—or even
twelve thousand, if we may believe <i>Pausanias</i>.
We should have exposed the fabulous
part of the history of <i>Sappho</i>, by following
Mr. C. F. Neue (<i>Sapphonis Mytilinææ fragmenta</i>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
and M. J. Mongin, in his remarkable article
on this poetess in <i>l’Encyclopédie nouvelle</i>; and
the learned Spon (<i>Miscellanies</i>) would have explained
to us the pretended tub of Diogenes.
Other innumerable errors would have been
brought before the reader, for we have only
cited a very small portion of the programme.</p>

<p>Alfred Maury (<i>Revue de Philosophie</i>) would
have convinced us that Cæsar never said, and
never would have said, to the pilot “Why do
you fear? You have Cæsar and his fortunes
on board,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>On all these subjects an analytical work
would be of great use, and for the benefit of
those who might be induced to undertake such
a task, we proceed to point out the principal
chapters in the work of Lancelotti.</p>

<p>1) Zaleucus submitted to have one of his eyes
put out, in order to save his son from the loss
of both his eyes.</p>

<p>2) The people living near the cataracts of
the Nile are all deaf.</p>

<p>3) The army of Xerxes drained the rivers
on its passage, to satisfy its thirst.</p>

<p>4) In Egypt the women occupy themselves
in commerce while the men remain at home
to manufacture cloth.</p>

<p>5) The account given by Titus Livius of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
resolution of the Roman senators at the taking
of Rome by the Gauls.</p>

<p>6) Agriculturists, or tillers of the ground,
are declared consuls and dictators by the Romans.</p>

<p>7) The Lake of Thrasymene takes fire.</p>

<p>8) The philosopher Anaxarchus bit off his
tongue and spat it in the face of the tyrant.</p>

<p>9) In a combat between Aëtius and Attila,
the blood of the soldiers killed and wounded
flowed in such torrents that the dead bodies
were swept away by it.</p>

<p>10) Ten Roman virgins, at the head of whom
was <i>Clelia</i>, after having been sent as hostages
to the king <i>Porsenna</i>, returned to Rome by
swimming across the Tiber.</p>

<p>11) Æschylus killed by a tortoise dropped
upon his head by an eagle.</p>

<p>12) In the school of Pythagoras the disciples
kept silence during the space of five years.</p>

<p>13) A grapestone caused the death of <i>Anacreon</i>;
and the senator <i>Fabius</i> was choked by
a hair in his milk.</p>

<p>14) <i>Mutius-Scævola</i> burned his hand to shew
his fortitude.</p>

<p>15) Among the Spartans all men lived in
common and ate in public on the same spot.</p>

<p>16) That the young girls in Sparta occupied
themselves in public duties, perfectly naked.</p>

<p>17) <i>Lycurgus</i> permitted the young men in
his republic to practise the art of stealing.</p>

<p>18) <i>Lycurgus</i> forbade the use of gold and
silver money in his republic. He allowed iron

<p>19) <i>Lycurgus</i> was the originator of the
concise, sententious language generally termed
<i>laconic</i>.</p>

<p>20) <i>Romulus</i> and <i>Remus</i> suckled by a she-wolf,

<p>25) The poverty of the grandees of Rome.</p>

<p>26) <i>Curtius</i> leaping on horseback into the

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c1">THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 306.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> the elementary works for the instruction
of young people, we find frequent mention of
the Colossus of Rhodes.</p>

<p>The statue is always represented with gigantic
limbs, each leg resting on the enormous
rocks which face the entrance to the principal
port of the Island of Rhodes; and ships in full
sail passed easily, it is said, between its legs;
for, according to Pliny the ancient, its height
was seventy cubits.</p>

<p>This Colossus was reckoned among the seven
wonders of the world, the six others being, as is
well known, the hanging gardens of Babylon,
devised by Nitocris wife of Nebuchadnezzar;
the pyramids of Egypt; the statue of Jupiter
Olympus; the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
temple of Diana at Ephesus; and the Pharos
of Alexandria, completely destroyed by an
earthquake in 1303.</p>

<p>Nowhere has any authority been found for the
assertion that the Colossus of Rhodes spanned
the entrance to the harbour of the island and
admitted the passage of vessels in full sail
between its wide-stretched limbs. No old
drawing even of that epoch exists, when the
statue was yet supposed to be standing; several
modern engravings may be seen, but they are
mere works of the imagination, executed to
gratify the curiosity of amateur antiquarians,
or to feed the naive credulity of the ignorant.
Nevertheless, the historian Rollin, several
French dictionaries, and even some encyclopedias,
have adopted the fiction of their predecessors.</p>

<p>A century ago, the Comte de Caylus, a
distinguished French archeologist, found fault
with his countrymen for admitting this fiction
into the school books<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for young people, but
he sought in vain to trace its origin.</p>

<p>Vigenère, in his <i>Tableaux de Philostrate</i>, is
supposed to have been the first who ventured
to make an imaginary drawing of the Colossus.
He was followed by Bergier and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Chevreau,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the latter adding a lamp to the
hand of the statue. A fictitious Greek manuscript,
quoted by the mythologist Du Choul,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
further adorns the Colossus by giving him
a sword and lance and by hanging a mirror
round his neck.</p>

<p>The Count Choiseul-Gouffier, in his <i>Picturesque
journey through Greece</i>, published about
the year 1780, declares the Colossus with the
outstretched legs to be fabulous.</p>

<p>He says: “This fable has for years enjoyed
the privilege so readily accorded to error. It
is commonly received, and discarded only by
the few who have made ancient history their
study. Most persons have accepted without
investigation an assertion which is unsupported
by any authority from ancient authors.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Belgian Colonel Rottiers,
and the English geologist Hamilton,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> do not
yield to this opinion, but endeavour still to
place the site of the statue at the entrance
to one of the smaller harbours of the island,
scarcely forty feet wide. Rottiers goes even
further, and gives a superb engraving of the
Colossus, under the form of an Apollo, the
bow and quiver on his shoulders, his forehead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
encircled by rays of light, and a beacon flame
above his head.</p>

<p>Polybius is the first among the ancient
writers who mentions the Colossus of Rhodes,
in enumerating the donations received by the
inhabitants of the island after the fearful
earthquake they experienced about 223 years
before Christ. “The Rhodians,” says he, “have
benefited by the catastrophe which befell
them, owing to which, not only the huge Colossus,
but innumerable houses and a portion
of the surrounding walls were demolished.”
Then follows a list of the rich gifts they received
from all parts. Among the benefactors
of the town of Rhodes, Polybius mentions the
three kings, Ptolemy III. of Egypt, Antigonos
Doson of Macedonia, and Seleucus of Syria,
father of Antiochus.</p>

<p>The elder Pliny records that the Colossus,
after having stood for fifty-six years, was
overthrown by an earthquake, and that it
took Charès of Lindos, to whom the Rhodians
had entrusted its re-construction, twelve years
to complete his task.</p>

<p>It is probable that the statue of Minerva,
from 50 to 60 feet in height, which was designed
and partly executed by Phidias for
the Acropolis at Athens, served as a model
for Charès, not only for the material, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
the conception of the Colossus and for the
site on which it stood.</p>

<p>Minerva was the patroness of Athens as
the sun-god Helios was the patron of the
island of Rhodes.</p>

<p>About 150 years before Christ a certain
Philo-Byzantius wrote a short treatise on the
seven wonders of the ancient world.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In it he
gives an explanation of the construction of the
Colossus, but nowhere speaks of the extended
legs under which vessels in full sail entered
the port, nor of the beacon light. On the
contrary, he mentions one sole pedestal, which
was of white marble. Moreover, the statue
was said to be 105 feet in height, and the
great harbour entrance, according to modern
research, was 350 feet wide; it could not
therefore possibly reach across this space.</p>

<p>Lastly, if the statue had stood at the entrance
of the great harbour, the earthquake must
have overthrown it into the sea, whereas
Strabo and Pliny tell us that its fragments
remained for a considerable time embedded
in the earth, and attracted much attention by
their wonderful size and dimensions.</p>

<p>The following is the real truth concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
the Colossus. Towards the year 305 before
Christ, Demetrius Poliorcetes laid siege to
Rhodes, and the inhabitants defended themselves
with so much bravery, that after a
whole year of struggle and endurance, they
forced the enemy to retire from the island.</p>

<p>The Rhodians, inspired by a sentiment of
piety, and excited by fervent gratitude for
so signal a proof of the divine favour, commanded
Charès to erect a statue to the honour
of their deity. An inscription explained that
the expenses of its construction were defrayed
out of the sale of the materials of war left
by Demetrius on his retreat from the island
of Rhodes.</p>

<p>This statue was erected on an open space
of ground near the great harbour, and near
the spot where the pacha’s seraglio now
stands; and its fragments, for many years
after its destruction, were seen and admired
by travellers.</p>

<p>This explanation is still further supported
by the fact, that a chapel built on this ground
in the time of the Templars is named <i>Fanum
Sancti Ioannis Colossensis</i>.</p>

<p>We have seen that Strabo, who wrote and
travelled during the reigns of the first two
Roman emperors, was, after Polybius, the
earliest author who mentions the fall of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Colossus of Rhodes, and that very concisely.
Pliny enters into somewhat fuller details, and
speaks of the dimensions of the mutilated
limbs. “Even while prostrate,” says he, “this
statue excited the greatest admiration; few
men could span one of its thumbs with their
arms, and each of its fingers was as large as
an ordinary full-sized statue. Its broken limbs
appeared to strangers like caverns, in the interior
of which were seen enormous blocks of
stone.”</p>

<p>From this time we find no further mention
whatever of these fragments, but it is remarkable
that towards the end of the second
century after Christ some writers speak of a
colossal statue at Rhodes as still existing. It
is possible that one was again constructed,
but of smaller dimensions. Indeed, <i>Leo Allazzi</i>
tells us that the Colossus of Rhodes was reconstructed
under the Emperor Vespasian.</p>

<p>Alios Aristides, who flourished between the
years 149 and 180 of the Christian era, wrote a
panegyric on the island of Rhodes, on the occasion
of another earthquake which happened
there under the reign of Antoninus Pius. He
alludes to demolished monuments, but he consoles
the inhabitants by telling them, that at
any rate all vestiges of their former grandeur
have not disappeared, and that they will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
be obliged, as in the former disaster [that of
<span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 407], to rebuild the greater part of their
town. He reminds them that, on the contrary,
the two basins of the port still remain, as
well as the theatre, the gymnasium, and <i>the
great bronze statue</i>.</p>

<p>This passage is certainly not very clear,
and it remains to be proved if the author here
speaks of the Colossus which had been restored
and had escaped the earthquake, or of some
other bronze statue.</p>

<p>Pausanias, who wrote shortly after Aristides,
speaks also in two places of the earthquake
in the time of Antoninus, without making any
mention of the Colossus; but in a description
of Athens, he alludes in terms of great admiration
to a temple of Jupiter built by
Adrian, and he adds: “The emperor consecrated
to it a magnificent statue of the god,
which surpassed all other statues except the
Colossus of Rhodes and of Rome.”</p>

<p>The author could hardly have made this
comparison if there had only existed in his
time fragments of the Colossus of Rhodes.</p>

<p>Lastly, the satirist Lucian makes frequent
mention of the Colossus, and he even introduces
it in a dialogue of the assembled gods.</p>

<p>It is probable, therefore, judging from these
passages from Aristides, Pausanias, and Lucian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
that, at the epoch in which they lived, the
Colossus of Rhodes had been restored or reconstructed;
for if during four centuries past
the fragments had been lying in the dust,
these writers would not have thus expressed
themselves.</p>

<p>A long time after the fall of the Roman
empire, the island of Rhodes was conquered
by the general-in-chief of the caliph Othman,
in the 7th century of the Christian era; and
then mention is once more made of a Colossus
in metal. “This last memorial of a glorious
past was not respected by the conqueror,” says
the Byzantine history; “the general took down
the Colossus, which stood erect on the island,
transported the metal into Syria, and sold it
to a Jew, who loaded 980 camels with the
materials of his purchase.”</p>

<p>Such is the account given by the Emperor
Constantine Porphyrogenetos, and confirmed
by that of Theophanes, Zonaras, and others.
As to the fable of the ancient Colossus between
whose gigantic limbs ships in full sail were
believed to have passed, we are disposed to
think that it originated at the time of the
Crusades, when the inhabitants of Rhodes
must have amused themselves by relating to
the new-comers all sorts of incredible stories
of their past grandeur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>We can refer those who may still be
anxious for further details on the Colossus of
Rhodes, to a treatise on the subject by Carl
Ferdinand Lüders, in which the fiction of the
extended limbs is completely disposed of; but
this treatise contains such an array of learned
accessories, <i>more germanico</i>, that few will probably
have the patience to read it through.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c2">BELISARIUS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 565.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> imagination of poets, painters, and sculptors,
backed by one of <i>Marmontel’s</i> novels,
has helped to make of an apocryphal tradition
a matter of history which has been believed
in by the many, who are ever open-mouthed
to receive the marvellous upon trust.</p>

<p>This tradition relates to the general Belisarius,
the conqueror of the Vandals, who,
after having been falsely accused of treason,
is said to have been deprived of his sight by
the Emperor Justinian, and to have been reduced
to such a state of poverty that he was
compelled to beg his bread in the streets of
Constantinople.</p>

<p>No contemporary historian mentions these
circumstances; but they have been repeated
age after age without examination, and several
learned men of repute, such as Volaterranus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Pontanus, &amp;c., have helped to propagate the
error in the literary world.</p>

<p>In the 16th century it was so unquestionably
accepted by the Italians, that they gave the
name of <i>Belisarius begging</i> to a beautiful
ancient statue then in the Borghese museum,
which Winckelmann, in his <i>Histoire de l’Art</i>,
has proved to be no other than a statue of
Augustus propitiating Nemesis.</p>

<p>Between the years 1637 and 1681, this
fable was made the subject of several tragedies.
In the following century Marmontel
composed and published his romance of Belisarius,
the conception of which arose from
an engraving that came into his possession.
In his Memoirs he himself thus explains the
circumstance:</p>

<p>“I had received a present of an engraving
of Belisarius taken from the fine picture of
him by Van Dyck. My eyes were continually
attracted to the face, and I was seized with
an irresistible desire to treat this interesting
subject in prose; and as soon as the idea took
possession of me, the pains in my chest and
lungs seemed to leave me as if by magic.
The pleasure of composing my story, the care
I took in arranging and developing it, occupied
my mind so entirely, that I was drawn away
from all thoughts of self.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>The novel was so successful that it was
translated into almost every language of Europe,
and three successive editions appeared. But
the really ludicrous part of the story is, that
in the preface to the edition of 1787, the
author declares that he has followed from
first to last the account given by Procopius,
while in fact the details presented by this
contemporary of Belisarius in the five first
chapters of his <i>Secret History</i> are diametrically
opposed to the picture drawn by Marmontel.</p>

<p>Thus then the fiction of blind Belisarius
begging was quickly propagated, and was
helped on by the artist David, who painted
in 1781 his celebrated picture of the general.
Again, in the reign of Napoleon I., M. Jouy
wrote a tragedy on this subject, but he only
obtained permission to bring it out in 1825,
and thanks to the immense talent of Talma
it was very well received. M. Jouy, in his
preface, showed his ignorance as an historian
by saying, “I have kept faithfully to the facts,
details, and characters authorised by history.”</p>

<p>Lastly, this error appears in modern times
in a Turkish tradition, and is noticed by Feller
in his <i>Universal Biography</i>. “There is shown
to this day,” says he, “a prison in Constantinople
called the <i>Tower of Belisarius</i>. It
stands on the borders of the sea, on the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
from the castle of the seven towers to the
seraglio. The common people say that the
prisoners let down a small bag at the end of
a string to solicit alms from the passers-by,
saying: “<i>Date obolum Belisario quem Fortuna
evexit, Invidia oculis privavit</i>.”</p>

<p>After having traced as briefly as possible
the origin of this fable, we will dwell for a
moment on the manner in which the best
and most learned critics have treated it.</p>

<p>The hackneyed story of Belisarius, blind and
begging, was unknown to all contemporary
authors without exception. Not one can be
quoted as having mentioned so remarkable a
circumstance. From the 6th to the 12th century,
no writer who speaks of this great
general ever alludes to his blindness or to
his poverty.</p>

<p>The French historian Le Beau, in his “<i>Histoire
du bas Empire</i>,” says: “The fall of Belisarius
gave rise to a ridiculous story which
has been for 600 years repeated by poets and
prose writers, but which all well-informed
authors have agreed in refuting.”</p>

<p>The real fact, drawn from the best sources,
and recorded by Gibbon, is this:</p>

<p>About two years after the last victory of
Belisarius over the Bulgarians, the Emperor
Justinian returned in bad health from a journey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
to Thracia. There being a rumour of his
death, a conspiracy was formed in the palace,
but the conspirators were detected, and on
being seized were found to have daggers hidden
under their garments. Two officers of
the household of Belisarius were accused, and
torture induced them to declare that they
had acted under the secret instructions of
their chief. Belisarius appeared before the
council, indignant and undaunted. Nevertheless,
his fidelity, which had remained unshaken
for forty years, availed him nothing.
The emperor condemned him without evidence;
his life was spared, but his fortune was sequestrated,
and from December 563 to July
564 he was guarded as a prisoner in his own
palace. At length his innocence was acknowledged,
and his freedom and honours were
restored; but death, which might possibly have
been hastened by grief and resentment, removed
him from the world within a year of
his liberation.</p>

<p>About 600 years after this event, John
Tzetzes, poet and grammarian, born in Constantinople,
attempted in ten bad Greek verses
to draw a picture of Belisarius deprived of
sight and penniless. The tale was imported
into Italy with the manuscripts of Greece, and
before the close of the 15th century it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
taken up by more than one learned writer
and universally believed.</p>

<p>The credulity of the multitude is such, that
they still persist in ignoring the refutation of
Samuel Schelling (<i>Dissertatio historica de Belisario</i>,
Witteb. 1665, in 4ᵗᵒ), of Th. Fr. Zeller
(<i>Belisarius</i>, Tubing. 1809, in 8ᵛᵒ), of Roth (<i>Ueber
Belisar’s Ungnade</i>, Bâle 1846, in 8ᵛᵒ) and many
others.</p>

<p>In a note to Gibbon’s <i>History</i> edited by
W. Smith LL.D., we see that two theories
have been started in modern times to account
for the fable of the beggary of Belisarius.
The first is that of Le Beau, who supposes
that the general was confounded with his
contemporary John of Cappadocia. This prætorian
prefect of the East, whose crimes deserved
a thousand deaths, was ignominiously
scourged like the vilest of malefactors, clothed
in rags and transported in a bark (542) to
the place of his banishment at <i>Antinopolis</i> in
Upper Egypt, and this ex-consul and patrician
was doomed to beg his bread in the cities
which had trembled at his name.</p>

<p>The second supposition is that of Mr. Finlay
(<i>History of the Byzantine Empire</i>), who suggests
that the story took its rise from the fate of
Symbatius and Peganes, who, having formed a
conspiracy against Michael III., in the 9th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
century, were deprived of their sight and exposed
as common beggars in Constantinople.</p>

<p>It is not likely, however, that the fate of
men in the ninth century should have been
confused with that of individuals in the sixth.</p>

<p>It is right to add, that Lord Mahon, in
his <i>Life of Belisarius</i>, argues in favour of the
tragic fate of Justinian’s celebrated general.
“But,” observes Dean Milman, “it is impossible
to obtain any satisfactory result without contemporary
evidence, which is entirely wanting
in the present instance.” These words from
the learned Milman lead us to suppose that
he rejects the authority of Procopius, who
accompanied Belisarius as counsellor and
secretary in his Eastern wars, in Africa, and
in Italy, as he himself informs us; and who,
in his <i>Anecdota</i>,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> devotes five chapters to the
life and misfortunes of Belisarius, without
saying one word either of his blindness or of
his abject poverty.</p>

<p>Ernest Renan, in his <i>Essais de morale et
de critique</i>, has also examined into the trustworthiness
of the <i>Secret History</i> of Procopius,
and he arrives at the opinion, that this author<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
had only exaggerated the crimes of the wicked
century in which Justinian lived. He would
then have been the last to soften the disgrace
incurred by Belisarius.</p>

<p>At the time of the fall of Napoleon I., a
popular song written by Népomucène Lemercier
on Belisarius, became more than ever in
vogue, as it contained allusions to the misfortunes
of the companions in arms and soldiers,
attached to the emperor. At all the
Bonapartist reunions they sang:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c3">THE ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 640.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">Ptolemy-Soter</span>, chief of the dynasty of the
Lagides, laid the foundation of the Alexandrian
library. It was afterwards enlarged by his son
Ptolemy Philadelphus and his successors; and
from this celebrated repository the city of
Alexandria derived the title of “<i>Mother of
Books</i>.”</p>

<p>There is much difference of opinion as to
the number of works contained in this library.
Instead of 54,800 volumes as asserted by St.
Epiphanes, or 200,000 according to Josephus,
Eusebius tells us, that at the death of Ptolemy
Philadelphus, 100,000 volumes were collected
in it.</p>

<p>The building was situated to the east of
the large sea-port, near the city of Canopus,
and became a prey to the flames when Julius
Cæsar, who was besieged in that part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
town in which the museum stood, ordered
the fleet to be set on fire. The wind unfortunately
carried the flames to the neighbouring
houses and to the locality of the
<i>Bruchion</i>, close to the site of the valuable
library.</p>

<p>Lucan, in his <i>Pharsalia</i>, has described this
conflagration with much spirit:<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Orosius tells us that 400,000 volumes were
destroyed by the fire: “So perished,” says he
“this monument of the learning and labour
of the ancients, who had amassed the works
of so many illustrious men.” “<i>Monumentum
studiique curæque majorum qui tot ac tanta
illustrium ingeniorum opera congesserant.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Cleopatra was not insensible to the loss of
so great a treasure, and Antony, to console
her, presented her with the whole collection
of books made by the king of Bithynia at
Pergamus, to the number of 200,000 volumes.
These books, with the few that had
escaped the flames, formed the second library,
and were placed in the <i>Serapeon</i>, or
temple of Serapis, which from that time
became the resort of all learned men. In
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 390, the fanatic Theophilus, patriarch
of Alexandria, worthy of being the friend of
the tyrant Theodosius, took advantage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
protection of that Emperor to disperse the
library of the <i>Serapeon</i>, and to drive out the
savans who assembled there. He overthrew
the temple itself and built a church on its
ruins which bore the name of the Emperor
Arcadius. It would thus appear that the
oldest and most extensive libraries of Alexandria
ceased to exist before the 5th century
of the Christian era. Nevertheless, there is
still an opinion maintained among learned
men that the immense collection made by the
Ptolemies was destroyed by the Arabs in the
7th century.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Several writers, with Gibbon at their head,
have rejected this notion. Reinhart published
at Göttingen in 1792 a special dissertation
on the subject. It was Gregorius Bar-Hebræus,
better known under the name of Abulpharadje,
elected primate of the East in 1264, who gave
the earliest account of the burning of the
library at Alexandria, in a chronicle he published
in Syriac, and afterwards translated into
Arabic at the solicitation of his friends.</p>

<p>He says: “John the grammarian came to
Amrou, who was in possession of Alexandria,
and begged that he might be allowed to
appropriate a part of the booty. ‘Which part
do you wish for,’ asked Amrou. John replied,
‘The books of philosophy which are in the
treasury (library) of kings.’ Amrou answered
that he could not dispose of these without
the permission of the Emir Al-Moumenin
Omar. He wrote to the Emir, who replied
in these terms: ‘As to the books you speak
of, if their contents are in conformity with
the Book of God (the Koran) we have no
need of them; if, on the contrary, their contents
are opposed to it, it is still less desirable
to preserve them, so I desire that they
may be destroyed.’ Amrou-Ben-Alas in consequence
ordered them to be distributed in
the various baths in Alexandria, to be burnt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
in the stoves; and after six months, not a
vestige of them remained.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>How open is this unlikely story to objection!
In the first place, John of Alexandria
was dead before the city was taken, on the
21st December 640.</p>

<p>D’Herbelot, in his <i>Bibliothèque Orientale</i>, tells
us that at that period four thousand baths
existed in Alexandria. What a multitude of
volumes it must have required to supply fuel
for them for the space of six months! And
then the absurdity of attempting to heat
baths with parchment!!!</p>

<p>Renaudot was the first in France who threw
a doubt on this story in his <i>Histoire des Patriarches
d’Alexandrie</i>. “It merely reposes,”
says he, “on Eastern tales, and these are never
to be relied upon.”</p>

<p>Kotbeddin, in his <i>History of Mecca</i>, from
which de Sacy quotes an extract in his <i>Notes
des Manuscrits</i>, Vol. IV. p. 569, relates seriously,
that at the taking of Bagdad by <i>Hulagou</i> the
destroyer, of the empire of the Caliphs, the
Tartars threw the books belonging to the
colleges of this city into the river Euphrates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
and the number was so great, that they formed
a bridge, over which foot-passengers and horsemen
went across!</p>

<p>Besides Abulpharadi, two other eastern
writers give an account of the destruction
of the library: Abd-Allatif and Makrizi; but
they only go over the same ground as their
predecessors.</p>

<p>These three writers (of the 12th, the 13th,
and the 15th centuries) are the less to be
relied upon as no other eastern historians who
speak of the conquest of Egypt by the Arabians,
mention the loss of their great repository
by fire.</p>

<p>Eutyches, the patriarch of Alexandria, who
lived in the 10th century, and who enters into
details of the taking of this city by the
Arabians; Elmacin, who, in the 13th century,
recounts the same fact; and Aboulfeda, who
at about the same period gives a description
of Egypt, completely ignore this remarkable
and important event.</p>

<p>How is it that the Greek authors, who were
so incensed against the Saracens, omit to speak
of this conflagration authorised by Omar?—and
that after centuries of silence Abulpharadi is
the first who opens his lips on the subject?
And it is still more surprising that this writer
did not mention the anecdote in his <i>Chronicle</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
published in Syriac, but that he only added
it while translating his work into Arabic at
the latter end of his life.</p>

<p>The Caliphs had forbidden under severe
penalties the destruction of all Jewish and
Christian volumes, and we nowhere hear of
any such work of destruction during the first
conquests of the Mahommedans.</p>

<p>Quite at the beginning of the 5th century,
Paulus Orosius, a disciple of St. Jerome, mentions,
on his return from Palestine, having
seen at Alexandria the empty book-cases
which the library had formerly contained.</p>

<p>All these arguments brought forward by
Assemanni, by Gibbon, by Reinhard, and many
others, do not appear to have convinced M.
Matter, although he admits in his <i>Histoire de
l’École d’Alexandrie</i>, that a certain amount of
courage is necessary to maintain the opinion
of the existence of an extensive collection of
books at the commencement of the conquest.</p>

<p>“There are two points beyond dispute,”
says he, “in this question. The first is, that
Alexandria possessed during the 5th and 6th
centuries, after the destruction of the <i>Serapeon</i>,
a library of sufficient importance to contain
many valuable literary works. The next is,
that these works, far from being limited to
religion and theology, as Gibbon supposes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
included various branches of study; of this
we cannot entertain a doubt when we reflect
on the later productions of the school of
Alexandria.”</p>

<p>In order to establish his argument, Matter
enters into long details. “Gibbon himself,”
he says, “would have admitted later that
Amrou might have burned other works in
Alexandria besides those on theology.”</p>

<p>Two orientalists, Langlès and de Sacy, have
adopted a very similar opinion. “It is incontestable,”
says the former, “that on the entrance
of the Mahommedans, a library still
existed at Alexandria, and that it fell a prey
to the flames.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>De Sacy allows that the story told by Abulpharadi
is very probable, and proves that at
that period the Mahommedans did demolish
libraries and destroy books, in spite of the
law against any such destruction.</p>

<p>At any rate this opinion has only been
adopted by a small minority, and Amrou is
generally exonerated from having been the
destroyer of the Alexandrian Library.</p>

</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 855.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">Is</span> it true that a woman succeeded in deceiving
her cotemporaries to the extent of
elevating herself to the pontifical throne?</p>

<p>Did a catastrophe ensue which afforded a
proof of her sex as unexpected as indisputable?</p>

<p>If there is no foundation for this tale, how
comes it that it has been so long accepted
as authentic by writers whose attachment to
the Roman church is perfectly sincere?</p>

<p>Such are the questions that we here propose
to ourselves, and which have been recently
treated by two Dutch literati, Mr. N.
C. Kist, professor at the university of Leyden,
in a work published in 1845; and Mr. J. H.
Wensing, professor at the seminary of Warmond,
who has written a refutation of Mr.
Kist’s work in a thick volume of more than
600 pages, printed at the Hague.</p>

<p>I will proceed to give a brief sketch of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
circumstances as presented to us by reliable
authors.</p>

<p>After the death of Leo IV., in the year 855,
the Roman people proceeded, according to the
custom of that period, to the nomination of
a sovereign pontiff. The choice fell upon a
foreigner who had for some years been resident
in the eternal city. He was held in high
repute, as well for his virtues as for his talents.
This stranger was a woman of English
origin, born in Germany, who had studied in
France and Greece, and who in the disguise
of a man had baffled all detection. Raised
to the pontifical throne, she assumed the name
of John VIII., and governed with exemplary
wisdom, but in private life was guilty of
irregularities which resulted in pregnancy. She
endeavoured to conceal her situation, but on
the occasion of a great religious festival she
was seized with sudden pains in the midst of
a procession, and, to the astonishment and
consternation of the crowd, gave birth to a
child who instantly expired. The mother herself
died upon the spot, succumbing to the
effects of pain, terror, and shame.</p>

<p>This is the most widely spread version; it
has however been asserted that the female
pope, “<i>la papesse</i>,” survived her mischance,
and ended her days in a dungeon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>Anastatius, deacon and librarian of the Roman
church, was living at this period, and
collected numerous materials for a history of
the sovereign pontiffs. He composed a series
of their biographies under the title of “<i>Liber
Pontificalis</i>,” and affirms that he was present
at the election of the Popes from Sergius III.
to John VIII., that is to say from 844 to 882.
He must then have been a witness to the catastrophe
of Joan. Now he makes no mention of
it, but, in his work, Pope Benedictus III. follows
immediately after Leo IV. An occurrence of
so extraordinary a nature must necessarily
have struck him. It has indeed been pretended
that he did make mention of it, but that his
account was suppressed by defenders of the
church, and that in some manuscripts it is
still to be found. Nevertheless these manuscripts,
very scarce and incorrect, only contain
one phrase to the purpose, which is met with
for the first time in the writings of the 14th
century. It is moreover accompanied by an
expression of doubt (<i>ut dicitur</i>) and there is
at the present time scarcely any enlightened
critic but would regard it as an interpolation
of the copyist.</p>

<p>The silence of Anastatius admits therefore
of but one interpretation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>It is not until two hundred years after
the alleged date of the event that the first
mention of it is found in the <i>Chronicon</i> of
Marianus Scotus, who was born in Scotland
in 1028, and died at Mayence in 1086.
He says: “Joan, a female, succeeded Pope
Leo IV. during two years, five months, and
four days.” A contemporary of Marianus
Scotus, Godfrey of Viterbo, made a list of
the sovereign pontiffs, in which we read between
Leo IV. and Benedict III., “<i>Papissa
Joanna non numeratur</i>” (the female Pope does
not count).</p>

<p>We must come to the 13th century to
find in the <i>Chronicon</i> of Martinus Polonus,
Bishop of Cosenza in Calabria, some particulars
respecting the female Pope Joan.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> At
this period a belief in the truth of her existence
is spread abroad, and the evidences become
more numerous, but they are little else but
repetitions and hear-says; no details of any
weight are given.</p>

<p>David Blondel,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> although a Protestant clergyman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
treated the story of Pope Joan as a fable.
The English bishop John Burnet is of the same
opinion, as well as Cave, a celebrated English
scholar. Several other learned men have amply
refuted this ancient tradition. Many have
thought to sustain the romance of Marianus
against the doubt excited by a silence of more
than 200 years, by asserting that the authors
who lived from the year 855 to 1050, refrained
from making any mention of the story on account
of the shame it occasioned them; and that
they preferred to change the order of succession
of the Popes by a constrained silence, rather
than contribute, by the enunciation of an
odious truth, to the preservation of the execrable
memory of the woman who had dishonoured
the papal chair. But how is it
possible to reconcile this with the other part
of the same story, that the Roman court was
so indignant at the scandal, that, to prevent
a repetition of it, they perpetuated its remembrance
by the erection of a statue, and
the prohibition of all processions from passing
through the street where the event had happened.
What shadow of truth can exist in
things so totally contradictory?</p>

<p>Moreover, Joseph Garampi<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> has proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
beyond dispute, that between the death of
Leo IV. and the nomination of Benedict III.,
there was no interval in which to place Pope
Joan, and the most virulent antagonists of
the court of Rome make no mention of her.</p>

<p>In 991 Arnolphus, bishop of Orleans, addressed
to a council held at Reims, a discourse in
which he vehemently attacked the excesses and
turpitudes of which Rome was guilty. Not
a word, however, was said on the subject of
Joan. The patriarch of Constantinople, Phocius,
who was the author of the schism which still
divides the Greek and Latin churches, and
who died in 890, says nothing respecting her.</p>

<p>The Greeks, who after him maintained eager
controversies against Rome, are silent respecting
Joan.</p>

<p>It is clear that the author who first speaks
of this event, after a lapse of two centuries,
is not worthy of credit, and that those who,
after him, related the same thing, have copied
from one another, without due examination.</p>

<p>Whilst rejecting as apocryphal the legend
under our consideration, some writers have
at the same time sought to explain its
origin.</p>

<p>The Jesuit Papebroch, one of the most industrious
editors of the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, thinks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
that the name “<i>papesse</i>” was given to John VII.,
because he shewed extreme weakness of character
in the exercise of his functions.</p>

<p>The Cardinal Baronius starts an hypothesis
of the same kind, but this conjecture is somewhat
far-fetched.</p>

<p>A chronicle inserted in the collection of
Muratori, <i>Rerum Italicarum Scriptores</i>, contains
an anecdote that has some analogy with
our subject.</p>

<p>A patriarch of Constantinople had a niece
to whom he was much attached. He disguised
her in male attire and made her pass for a
man. At his death he recommended her to
his clergy, without divulging the secret of her
sex. She was very learned and virtuous, and
was elected Patriarch. She remained eighteen
months on the throne, but the Prince of
Benevent, having become acquainted with the
truth, denounced the fraud at Constantinople,
and the <i>patriarchess</i> was immediately expelled.</p>

<p>This anecdote was very generally reported
and credited in Italy in the 11th century, for
Pope Leo IX., in a letter of 1053, written
to the Patriarch of Constantinople, expresses
himself thus:—</p>

<p>“Public report asserts as an undeniable fact,
that in defiance of the canons of the first
council of Nice, you Greeks have raised to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the pontifical throne, eunuchs, and even a
woman.”</p>

<p>At this period Rome had not yet begun
to occupy herself with the legend of Joan,
which was scarcely spread abroad in Germany.
If in the East there had been any idea of
the scandal of the female Pope, which was
afterwards so prevalent, the reproach of Leo IX.
would undoubtedly have been turned against
himself.</p>

<p>We give another explanation: “The strangest
stories have always their foundation in some
truth,” says <i>Onuphrius Panvinius</i>, in his notes
upon <i>Platina</i>: “I think that this fable of the
woman Joan takes its origin from the immoral
life of Pope John XII., who had many concubines,
and amongst others Joan, who exercised
such an empire over him that for some time
it might be said it was she who governed.
Hence it is that she was surnamed “<i>papesse</i>,”
and this saying, taken up by ignorant writers
and amplified by time, has given birth to the
story which has had such wide circulation.</p>

<p>We find in the history of the Bishop of
Cremona, Luitprand,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that the love of John XII.
for his concubine Joan went so far that he
gave her entire cities, that he despoiled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
church of St. Peter of crosses and of golden
chalices in order to lay them at her feet; and
we are told that she died in childbed.</p>

<p>This death is a remarkable circumstance.
In it we may trace the source of the most
striking event in the story of Pope Joan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c5">ABELARD AND ELOISA.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1140.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">We</span> had already collected many notes with
the intention of examining critically the celebrated
history of these two lovers of the
12th century, when we read an article by
Mr. F. W. Rowsell in the <i>St. James’s Magazine</i>
for October 1864, in which he gives a
sketch of the lives of both of them. The
writer has succeeded in condensing into half
a dozen very amusing pages a complete <i>résumé</i>
of the leading events in their history;
only he has followed the commonly received
opinion held by many English and French
historians who have taken up the subject, and
he does not enter into a critical examination
of several points at issue.</p>

<p>Everybody knows how great an attraction
the monument erected to the memory of Eloisa
and Abelard is to the crowds who visit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
cemetery of Père la Chaise, recalling to their
minds the letters full of love and passion
written by Eloisa, which have elicited so
many imitations both in prose and verse in
England and in France.</p>

<p>The history of the two lovers being true
as a whole, we are far from wishing to take
away from the sympathy that their constancy
and hapless love so well deserve. Our only
object is to separate the true from the false,
and to show that the celebrated letters imputed
to Eloisa were not written by her at
all, and that the tomb in Père la Chaise is
altogether a modern construction.</p>

<p>Abelard, born in 1079, died in 1164, and
Eloisa survived him upwards of twenty years,
dying in 1184.</p>

<p>The works and correspondence of Abelard
were published for the first time in 1616 by
the learned Duchesne, and we therein find
three letters from Eloisa to Abelard and four
from Abelard to Eloisa. These are the letters
on which Pope, in England, and Dorat,
Mercier, Saurin, Colardeau, &amp;c., in France,
founded their poems.</p>

<p>Out of these seven letters, four only can
strictly be termed the amatory correspondence
of the two lovers. The remainder, and those
that have been brought to light and published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
in later years, are pious effusions which contain
no trace whatever of those passionate
emotions which pervaded the four other letters.
We must remind the reader that the
oldest manuscript existing of these epistles is
nothing more than an alleged copy of the
originals made one hundred years after the
death of Eloisa. It is preserved in the library
of the town of Troyes, and belongs to the
latter half of the 13th century.</p>

<p>A modern French historian, M. Henri Martin,
having written some pages in a melodramatic
style on these letters of Eloisa, a
critic, M. de Larroque,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> pointed out to him
the error into which he had fallen, they
having evidently been composed some years
after the death of the heroine.</p>

<p>The learned Orelli published in 4ᵗᵒ at Zurich,
in 1841, what may be termed the memoirs
of Abelard, entitled, <i>Historia Calamitatum</i>:
also the seven letters of the two lovers.</p>

<p>In the preface to this work, Orelli declares,
that on many grounds he believes that these
letters, so different from such as might have
been expected from Eloisa, were never written
by her. The grounds, which Orelli omits to
state, are supplied by M. Lalanne in “<i>La</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
<i>Correspondance Littéraire</i>” of the 5th December
1856.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at a clear perception of
the improbabilities and contradictions contained
in these epistles, all the bearings of
the case should be kept well in mind.</p>

<p>In the <i>Historia Calamitatum</i>, Abelard opens
his heart to a friend who is in affliction and
whom he endeavours to console by drawing
a counter picture of his own misery. The
writer relates his life from his birth; his
struggles and his theological triumphs; his
passion for Eloisa, the vengeance of Fulbert,
her uncle, the canon of Paris; his wandering
life since he assumed the cowl in the abbey
of St. Denis; the foundation of the convent
of the Paraclete, where he received Eloisa and
the nuns of the convent of Argenteuil; and
lastly his nomination as Abbé of the monastery
of St. Gildas, where the monks more
than once conspired against his life.</p>

<p>This is about the only document we possess
regarding the life of Abelard, for it is remarkable
that the contemporary writers are
singularly concise in all that concerns him.
Otho, bishop of Freisingen, who died in 1158,
is the only one who makes even an allusion
to the vengeance of Fulbert; and he expresses
himself so vaguely that his meaning would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
be incomprehensible were we not able to explain
it by the help of the <i>Historia Calamitatum</i>.</p>

<p>According to these memoirs, Abelard was
thirty-seven or thirty-eight years of age when
he became enamoured of Eloisa, who was then
sixteen or seventeen years old. He introduced
himself into the household of the Canon
Fulbert, was appointed professor to the young
girl, and soon became domesticated in the family.
Eloisa, becoming soon after pregnant,
fled to Brittany, where she gave birth to a son.
She afterwards returned to Paris, and after
frequent negotiations between Fulbert and
Abelard, the lovers were at length married,
but the marriage was kept secret.</p>

<p>The rest is known. Abelard, fearfully mutilated,
became a monk in the abbey of St.
Denis, and at his bidding, to which she was
ever entirely submissive, Eloisa took the veil
in the convent of Argenteuil.</p>

<p>These events occupied about the space of
two years, and bring us to 1118 or 1119.</p>

<p>In a council held in Paris ten years later
(1129) a decree was passed expelling Eloisa
and the other nuns from the convent of Argenteuil,
which the Abbé Suger had claimed as being
a dependance of the <i>Abbaye de St. Denis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>This expulsion coming to the ears of Abelard,
he offered the nuns an asylum in the
Paraclete, which he had lately founded, and
which he soon after made over to them as
a gift.</p>

<p>Pope Innocent II. confirmed this gift in
1131. Abelard speaks further, in his <i>Historia
Calamitatum</i>, of events befalling a year later,
and of his return to the abbey of St. Gildas.
We see therefore that this memoir, written
with much care and attention, cannot have
been published before 1133, and perhaps even
long after that. Abelard was then in his
fifty-fourth year and Eloisa in her thirty-second
or thirty-third. About fourteen years
had elapsed since both had embraced the
monastic life: in the meanwhile they had met
and had spent more or less time together in
the Paraclete between 1129 and 1132.</p>

<p>Let us now enquire if the subject matter
contained in these seven letters, all of which
were written after the latter date (a fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
should be carefully noted) agrees with that
which has preceded.</p>

<p>The amorous correspondence of the lovers
is confined to four letters. The first is written
by Eloisa. She says, that if she writes
to Abelard at all, it is that she has by accident
seen the <i>Historia Calamitatum</i>; and in
order to convince him that she has read it,
she touches briefly on each circumstance recorded
in it, every one of which must have
been only too familiar to them both.</p>

<p>Does the reader think this a natural or a
probable style of commencement? Does it not
denote something artificial in the composition?
Farther on she complains that Abelard has
forsaken her: “her to whom the name of
mistress was dearer than that of wife, however
sacred this latter tie might be.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>And finally she adds: “Only tell me if you
can, why, since we have taken the monastic
vows, which you alone desired, you have so
neglected and forgotten me that I have neither
been blessed by your presence nor consoled
by a single letter in your absence. Answer
me, I beseech you, if you can, or I may myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
be tempted to tell you what I think, and
what all the world suspects.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>This letter, full of passionate reproach, contains
contradictions and improbabilities perceptible
to all who have read that which has
preceded.</p>

<p>Let us first call attention to the style, which
is hardly to be explained. The passionate
expressions of Eloisa would have been quite
natural in the first years that followed her
separation from Abelard, but fourteen years
had elapsed—fourteen years of monastic life to
both one and the other.</p>

<p>She appeals to a man of fifty-four years
of age, cut off for the space of fourteen years
from all intercourse with her, worn out by
his theological contests, his wandering life,
and the persecutions of which he had been
the victim; and who prays only, according to
his own letters, “for eternal rest in the world
to come.” But nothing checks the flow of her
passion, which she pours out with a vehemence
the more remarkable as proceeding from a
woman of whom Abelard had not long since
written, in his <i>Historia Calamitatum</i>: “All are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
alike struck by her piety in the convent, her
wisdom, and her incomparable gentleness and
patience under the trials of life. She is seldom
to be seen, but lives in the solitude of
her cell, the better to apply herself to prayer
and holy meditation.”</p>

<p>But the continuation seems even more incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Admitting, which is somewhat difficult, that
Eloisa had not seen Abelard since his severe
affliction until his reception of her in the
Paraclete in 1129, on her expulsion from Argenteuil,
is it at all certain that they did
meet then, and that moreover the frequency
of their interviews gave rise to scandalous
reports which obliged them again to separate?
How then can Eloisa complain that since their
entrance upon a religious life (that is to say
since 1119) she has “neither rejoiced in his
presence, nor been consoled by his letters?”
And she wrote this in 1133 or 1134! It is
incredible that these lines should have been
penned by her.</p>

<p>The second letter of Eloisa is not less ardent
than the first. She mourns in eloquent
language over the cold tone of sadness pervading
the answer sent to her by Abelard.
She reverts at some length to the cruel cause
of their separation, and deplores her misfortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
in such unequivocal terms, that we think it
better to give her words in their original
latin. “<i>Difficillimum est a desideriis maximarum
voluptatum avellere animum. ... In tantum
vero illæ quæs pariter exercuimus amantium voluptates
dulces mihi fuerunt ut nec displicere
mihi nunc, nec a memoria labi possint.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Quocumque loco me vertam, semper se oculis
meis cum suis ingerunt desideriis. Nec etiam
dormienti suis illusionibus parcunt. Inter ipsa
missarum solemnio, obscæna earum voluptatum
fustasmata ita sibi penitus miserrimam captivant
animam ut turpitudinibus illis magis quam orationi
vacem. Quæ cum ingemiscere debeam de
commissis, suspiro potius de amissis; nec solum
quæ egimus, sed loca pariter et tempora in quibus
hæc egimus ita tecum nostro infixa sunt
animo, ut in ipsis omnia tecum agam, nec dormiens
etiam ab his quiescam. Nonnunquam et
ipso motu corporis, animi mei cogitationes deprehenduntur,
nec a verbis temperant improvisis
... castam me prædicant qui non deprehenderunt
hypocritam.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>These expressions, scarcely equalled by the
delirium of Sappho, succeed at length in rekindling
the expiring passion of Abelard.
He replies by quotations from Virgil, from
Lucanus, and by passages from the Song of
Solomon. To convince her that their sorrows
are not unmerited, he reminds her on his side
of their past pleasures, and among others, of
a sacrilegious interview held in the refectory
of the convent of Argenteuil, where he had
visited her in secret.</p>

<p>He then, and more than once, enlarges in
praise of eunuchs, and ends by enclosing a
prayer he has composed for her and for himself.</p>

<p>This closes the amorous correspondence, for
in the next letter Eloisa declares her resolution,
to which she remains firm, of putting
a restraint on the ardour of her feelings, although
she cannot at the same time refrain
from quoting some equivocal lines from Ovid’s
<i>Art of Love</i>.</p>

<p>We must here once more ask whether, circumstanced
as these two lovers were, and
taking into consideration the piety and resignation
apparent in all the writings of Abelard,
he being at the time fifty-four years of
age, and Eloisa thirty-three—and after fourteen
years’ separation, it is credible or possible
that the letters we have quoted, letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
in which all modesty is laid aside, should
have been written by Eloisa? Allowing that
she had preserved Abelard’s correspondence,
is it easy to suppose that Abelard, continually
moving from place to place, should
have preserved hers to the day of his death,
so that their letters might eventually be brought
together?—letters, too, breathing an ardour
so compromising to the reputation of both?</p>

<p>Is it likely that Eloisa should have kept
copies of her own letters, the perusal of
which, it must be confessed would not have
tended to the edification of the nuns?</p>

<p>Remember also that all these events occurred
in the first half of the 12th century,
in an age when it was very unusual to make
collections of any correspondence of an amorous
nature.</p>

<p>We can then only arrive at the same conclusion
as Messieurs Lalanne, Orelli, Ch. Barthélemy,
and others, viz. that the correspondence
which has given such renown to the
names of Abelard and Eloisa as lovers, is in
all probability apocryphal.</p>

<p>M. Ludovic Lalanne has another supposition,
which is curious, and which appears to us
not to be impossible:</p>

<p>“These letters,” says he, “are evidently very
laboured. The circumstances follow each other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
with great regularity, and the vehement emotions
that are traceable throughout, do not in
any wise interfere with the methodical march
of the whole. The length of the letters, and
the learned quotations in them from the Bible,
from the fathers of the church, and from
pagan authors, all seem to indicate that they
were composed with a purpose and with art,
and were by no means the production of a
hasty pen. Eloisa, we must remember, was a
woman of letters, and a reputation for learning
was of great value in her eyes. Did she, who
survived her lover upwards of twenty years,
wish to bequeath to posterity the memory of
their misfortunes, by herself arranging and
digesting at a later period, so as to form a
literary composition, the letters that at divers
times she had written and received? Or has
perhaps a more eloquent and experienced pen
undertaken the task? These are questions
difficult to resolve. Anyhow, the oldest manuscript
of this correspondence with which
we are acquainted, is upwards of a hundred
years posterior to the death of Eloisa. It is,
as we have already said, the manuscript of
the library of the town of Troyes.”</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to examine the authority
for the so-called tomb of these lovers in
the cemetery of Père la Chaise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>Two learned archæologists will enlighten
us on the subject. Monsieur Lenoir,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> in his
<i>Musée des Monuments français</i>, and Monsieur
de Guilhermy, in an article of the <i>Annales
Archéologiques de Didron</i> for 1846.</p>

<p>During the French Revolution of 1792, the
convent of the Paraclete, founded by Abelard,
was sold. In order to protect the remains of
the lovers from desecration, which was too
common in those days, some worthy inhabitants
of Nogent-sur-Seine, took possession of
the coffins and deposited them in the church
of that town. Seven years later M. Lenoir
obtained the permission of the minister to
transfer these remains to Paris, and it occurred
to him at the same time, that it would be
expedient to enclose them in a tomb of the
period in which the lovers had lived. He was
told that in the chapel of the infirmary of
Saint Marcel-les-Chalons, Peter the Venerable
had erected a monument to Abelard. Several
denied this fact; but be that as it may, Monsieur
Lenoir obtained possession of part of
this monument, which had been purchased by
a physician of the town in order to save it
from destruction. M. Lenoir then constructed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
a monument with the fragments of a chapel
of the abbey of St. Denis, and, as he tells
us, placed the sarcophagus, which was of the
style of architecture in vogue in the 12th
century, in a room of the museum entrusted
to his care.</p>

<p>The following information given by M. de
Guilhermy<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> will show us how far M. Lenoir
succeeded in his architectural device, and how
far the sarcophagus contains the actual remains
of Abelard and Eloisa:</p>

<p>“How many illusions,” says M. de Guilhermy,
“would vanish into thin air if the
pilgrims who came to visit the shrine of these
celebrated lovers in the cemetery of Père la
Chaise only knew, that in the construction of
the sepulchral chapel there is not one single
stone from the abbey of the Paraclete. The
pillars, the capitals, the rose-works, which decorate
the facings of the tomb belonged to
the abbey of St. Denis. It does not require a
very practised eye to discover that the sculptures
are not in harmony, and were never
intended to form a whole. It was the former
director of the <i>Musée des Monuments Français</i>,
who conceived the idea of putting together
some fragments placed at his disposal, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
with these to erect a monument worthy of
receiving the bones of the two illustrious
lovers of the 12th century.</p>

<p>“A wooden case sealed with the republican
seal of the municipality of Nogent-sur-Seine,
carried to Paris in 1799 the remains which
were taken out of the grave in the Paraclete;
but before depositing them in their new asylum,
it was thought necessary to satisfy the amateurs
of relics of this nature. The republicans
opened the box, and all that was left
of the bodies after a period of six hundred
years was stolen out of it.” M. de Guilhermy
says that: “Actually a tooth of Eloisa was
offered for sale at the time. At any rate it
was in the following manner that the tomb
of Abelard was completed. A bas-relief which
represented the funeral procession of Louis,
the eldest son of Louis IX. of France, was
taken from St. Denis, and it was decided
that for the future this piece of sculpture
should do duty for the mausoleum of Abelard.
Two medallions, the work of a second-rate
artist of the 16th century, represented
Abelard with curled mustachios, and Eloisa
under the form of a half-naked woman.”</p>

<p>“But this is not all. On the sarcophagus
are two recumbent figures. One is draped
in priestly robes and was purloined from one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
of the numerous cloisters demolished in Paris;
the other is the statue of some noble lady
in the costume and style befitting the 14th
century, which once reclined on a tomb
in the chapel of St. Jean de Beauvais in
Paris.”</p>

<p>It is as well to recall such details as these
in order to expose errors which, unless refuted,
would from their long standing end by
being accepted as truths. But after reading
all the circumstances narrated above, can it
be believed that Monsieur Guizot, who is so
well acquainted with the real facts, or who
at any rate ought to be acquainted with them,
should, in order to gratify the public taste for
sentiment, write as follows in the preface to
a translation of the letters of Abelard and
Eloisa:<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>“<i>Vingt-et-un ans après la mort d’Abailard,
c’est-à-dire en 1163, agée de 63 ans, Héloïse
descendit dans le même tombeau. Ils y reposent
encore l’un et l’autre, après six cent
soixante-quinze ans, et tous les jours de fraiches
couronnes, déposées par des mains inconnues,
attestent pour les deux morts la sympathie sans</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
<i>cesse renaissante des générations qui se succèdent!</i>”</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a more inflated
style with which to decorate an historical
error.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c6">WILLIAM TELL.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1307.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">Formerly</span> an historical fact needed only the
authority of tradition to be generally received
and duly established; but in the present day
the critic is not so easily satisfied, and insists
upon proof as a basis for his belief.</p>

<p>In the field of history we meet with many
contested points, but it is rare to find an
error persistently maintained during five hundred
years, in spite of the refutation of innumerable
authors.</p>

<p>This is the case with the tale of William
Tell, which is nothing more nor less than a
northern saga that has been adopted and
repeated from generation to generation.</p>

<p>The revolution which took place in Switzerland
in 1307 gave rise to the legend of the
Swiss hero, and, from that time to the present,
writers have continually endeavoured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
to expose its unsound basis, but the public,
equally pertinacious, have insisted on believing
in its truth.</p>

<p>The study of historical and popular legends
is the study of a peculiar phase of the human
mind, and is one of the aspects under which
the history of a people should be considered.</p>

<p>All epochs of ignorance or superstition have
been remarkable for a strong belief in the
marvellous. The object of belief may vary,
but the disposition to believe is the same.</p>

<p>In order to place the history of William
Tell as clearly as possible before the reader,
let us in the first place turn to the writings
of the old Swiss chroniclers. Conrad Justinger,
who died in 1426, is one of the most ancient.
He was chancellor of the city of Bern, and
the composition of a chronicle of this canton
was committed to him. It does not extend
beyond the year 1421.</p>

<p>Melchior Russ, registrar at Lucerne in 1476,
copies word for word in his chronicle the
narrative of Conrad Justinger concerning the
political state of the Waldstätten, their disputes
with the Hapsburg dynasty, and the
insurrection of the country.</p>

<p>The Bernese chronicler attributes the insurrection
of the Alpine peasantry to the services
required and the heavy burdens imposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
upon them by the house of Hapsburg, and to
the ill-treatment the men, women, and girls
endured from the governors of the country.
In support of this accusation Melchior Russ
cites an example; he says: “William Tell was
forced by the seneschal to hit with an arrow
an apple placed on the head of his own son,
failing in which, he himself was to be put to
death.” It is here that Russ takes up the
narrative of Justinger, and continues the history
of Tell in a chapter entitled: “<i>Adventure
of Tell on the Lake</i>.”</p>

<p>“Tell resolved to avenge himself of the
cruel and unjust treatment he had long endured
from the governor and the magistrates.
He went into the canton of Uri, assembled
the commune, and told them with sobs of
emotion of the tyranny and persecution to
which he was every day exposed. His complaints
coming to the ears of the governor,
he ordered Tell to be seized, to be bound
hand and foot, and to be carried in a boat
to a fortified castle situated in the centre of
the lake. During the passage across a violent
tempest arose, and all on board, giving
themselves up for lost, began to implore the
aid of God and of the saints. It was suggested
to the governor that Tell, being vigorous
and skilled in nautical matters, was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
only one likely to help them out of their
danger. Aware of their imminent peril, the
governor promised that Tell’s life should be
spared if he succeeded in landing all the
passengers in safety. On his promising to do
so he was set free, and manœuvred so well
that he steered close to a flat rock, snatched
up his cross-bow, leapt ashore at one bound,
and, aiming at the governor, shot him dead.
The crew were home away in the boat, which
Tell had quickly pushed off from the shore,
and he regained the interior, where he continued
to excite the people to rebellion and
to revolt.”</p>

<p>We will now quote from Peterman Etterlein,
another chronicler, whose work was first
published at Bâle in 1507:</p>

<p>“Now it happened one day that the seneschal
(or governor), named Gressler (or Gessler),
came to the canton of Uri, and ordered a pole
to be fixed on a spot much frequented by
the people. A hat was placed on the top of
the pole, and a decree was published commanding
every passer-by to do homage to
the hat as if the governor himself stood there
in person. Now there was in the canton a
worthy man named William Tell, who had secretly
conspired with Stöffacher and his companions.
This man passed and repassed several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
times in front of the pole and the hat without
saluting them. The official on guard reported
the circumstance to his master, who, when he
became acquainted with this act of insubordination,
summoned Tell to his presence, and
demanded the reason of his disobedience. “My
good Lord,” said Tell, “I could not imagine
that your Grace would attach so much importance
to a salute; pardon me this fault,
therefore, and impute it to my thoughtlessness.
Now William Tell was the most skilful crossbowman
that it was possible to find, and he
had pretty children whom he tenderly loved.
The governor said to him: ‘It is reported
that thou art a celebrated archer; thou shalt
give me a proof of thy skill in bringing down
with thine arrow an apple placed on the
head of one of thy children. If thou dost
not hit it at the first trial it shall cost thee
thy life.’</p>

<p>“It was in vain that Tell remonstrated with
the governor; he refused to relent, and he
himself placed the apple on the head of the
child. Thus driven by hard necessity, Tell
first took an arrow which he slipt under his
doublet, and then took another which he fitted
to his bow. Having prayed to God and to
the holy Virgin to direct his arm and to save
his son, he brought down the apple without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
wounding the child. The governor had perceived
that he concealed the first arrow, and
questioned him as to his reason for so doing,
and after much hesitation on the one part
and terrible menaces on the other, Tell confessed
that if he had struck his child, he should
have shot the governor with the second arrow.
Well, replied Gessler, I have promised thee
thy life and I will keep my word, but since
I am acquainted with thy evil intentions, I
will confine thee in a place where thou wilt
never see the sun nor the moon, and where
thou wilt no longer have it in thy power to
attempt my life. He immediately ordered his
attendants to seize Tell, and he embarked
with them and the prisoner for his castle of
Küssenach, where he resolved to shut up his
victim in a dark tower. Tell’s arms were
placed in the stern of the boat, close to the
governor.”</p>

<p>As in the preceding narrative, a storm
arises, and Tell, to whom the care of the
vessel is confided, leaps upon a rock, lies in
ambush in a hollow through which the governor
must pass to reach his castle, and kills
him with an arrow from his bow.</p>

<p>The other chroniclers have followed the
same story, sometimes modifying it and at
others subjecting it to a critical examination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Now there are four different views existing
of this tradition of William Tell. The first
admits the authenticity of the legend in all
its details, as it is believed in the canton of
Uri.</p>

<p>The second admits the existence of Tell, his
refusal to do homage to the hat, his voyage
on the lake, and the tragical end of Gessler;
but it rejects the story of the apple.</p>

<p>According to the third view, William Tell
is believed to have existed and to have made
himself remarkable by some daring exploit;
but this exploit was not connected with the
plans of the conspirators, and consequently
exercised no influence over the formation of
the Swiss confederation.</p>

<p>The fourth view supposes the tradition of
William Tell to be a mere fable, an afterthought,
unworthy of being inserted in any
history of Switzerland.</p>

<p>We know of no chronicle anterior to those
of Melchior Russ and Petermann Etterlein that
records the events of which the tradition of
William Tell is composed. And so great a
difference is perceptible between the two histories,
that it would be presumption to maintain
that the one emanates from the other, or
that they have been drawn from a common
source.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>However it is far from being the fact that
all the historical works written by the cotemporaries
of this hero have been destroyed or
buried in oblivion. Freudenberger, in his
<i>Danish Fable</i>, has cited several of them. Franz
Guillimann, in his work <i>De rebus Helveticis</i>,
published at Fribourg in 1598, inserted the
history of William Tell, although he regarded
it as a mixture of fiction and probable facts,
or rather as a conventional truth that does
not bear examination; for he casts a doubt
upon the very existence of the personage
whose memory the Swiss people honour as
their liberator.</p>

<p>In one of his letters, addressed to Goldast,
27th March 1607, he writes thus: “You ask
me what I think of the history of William
Tell: here is my answer. Although in my
<i>Helvetian Antiquities</i> I have yielded to the popular
belief in introducing certain details connected
with that tale, still when I look more
closely into it, the whole thing appears to me
to be a pure fable; and that which confirms
me in my opinion is, that up to this time I
have never met with any writer anterior to
the 15th century who alludes to any such
history. It appears to me that all the circumstances
have been invented to foment the
hatred of the confederate states against Austria.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
I could produce my reasons for supposing this
story of Tell to be a fabrication; but why
should we waste time on such a subject?”</p>

<p>Here then we have a respectable historian,
the author of a learned work on the antiquities
of Switzerland, confessing himself obliged to
admit an error because it is popular! Perhaps
also, in his own interest, it was safer to do
so, for a few years later (in 1760) Uriel Freudenberger
created a terrible disturbance in
Bern by publishing a small volume in Latin
entitled <i>William Tell, a Danish Fable</i>, which
was by many attributed to Emmanuel Haller.
The canton of Uri condemned the author to
be burned with his book, and on the 14th of
June in the same year it addressed a very
urgent letter to the other cantons, advising
them to pass a like sentence.</p>

<p>The work of Freudenberger having been
burnt, the copies became extremely scarce,
but it was reprinted in Breyer’s <i>Historical
Magazine</i>, Vol. I. p. 325. The same text was
also reproduced—but only in order to be
partially refuted—in the work of Hisely,
published at Delft in 1826 under the title:
“<i>Of William Tell and the Swiss Revolution of
1307; or the history of the early cantons up to
the treaty of Brunnen in 1315</i>.”</p>

<p>In the latter half of the 17th century, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
writer as eminent as Guilliman, J. H. Rahn,
after recording in his chronicle the history
of Tell according to the tradition, explains
his reasons for regarding it as fabulous, or
at least as open to suspicion.</p>

<p>Later still, another writer, Isaac Christ.
Iselin, in his large historical dictionary (<i>Historisches
und geographisches allgemeines Lexicon</i>,
Basel 1727, in folio) says, that although several
authors cite this story, it is nevertheless
open to doubt, because 1) the ancient annalists
are silent on the subject, and 2) because Olaus
Magnus has related the same adventure of a
certain Toko, in the reign of Harold king of
Denmark. There is so great a similarity between
the two stories that it is impossible
to avoid supposing that one has been copied
from the other.</p>

<p>Two important publications express themselves
in a still more positive manner. In
the chronicle of Melchior Russ, edited by
Schneller of Lucerne, the editor, in learned
notes, conveys serious doubts upon the story
and even upon the very existence of William
Tell. These doubts acquire a fresh importance
from the collection of documents published
in 1835 by Kopp, a man of letters,
who shows how slight is the foundation for
the tradition which makes Tell the avenger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
of oppressed liberty. It will be seen that the
Swiss writers of the 15th and 16th centuries,
far from being agreed as to the time at which
Tell is said to have signalised himself by an
act of heroism, refer this event, on the contrary,
to different periods, and separate the
two extremes of the dates by a space of forty
years. Kopp renders the story of the apple
still more doubtful, by the positive assurance
that the administration of Küssenach was
never in the hands of a Gessler. This assertion
is founded on the charters, which denote
the uninterrupted succession of the administrators
of Küssenach during the century in
which the incident in question is said to have
taken place. The notes of M. Kopp contain
precise indications which shake the basis upon
which rests the history of William Tell, and
threaten to overthrow it.</p>

<p>Thus, in resuming, we see that the most
ancient work which makes any mention of
the adventures of William Tell is the chronicle
of Melchior Russ junior, written at the
end of the 15th century. Hence it follows
that this story was not known until two centuries
after the event (1296 to 1482), and that
the chronicles of the middle ages, so eager
after extraordinary facts and interesting news,
were entirely ignorant of it. Indeed, Hammerlin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
and Faber, writers of the 15th century,
and Mutius a chronicler at the beginning of the
16th century, narrate in detail the tyrannical
conduct of Austria, which they consider as
the principal cause of the insurrection of the
Swiss people; but not one of them speaks
of a Tell or of a William, neither of the
story of the apple, nor of the tragical end
of Gessler. Moreover, we possess the work of
a contemporary of William Tell, Jean de Winterthür,
whose chronicle is one of the best of
the 14th century. He recounts the details of
the war which the herdsmen of the Alps
waged against Austria. He describes with remarkable
precision the battle of Morgarten,
the particulars of which he had gathered from
the lips of his father, an eye-witness of it.
He says, that on the evening of that day so
fatal to Austria, he saw the Duke Leopold
arrive in flight, pallid and half-dead with
fright. Jean de Winterthür also tells us that
the heroes of Morgarten instituted, on the very
day of their victory, a solemn festival to perpetuate
the remembrance of it. But this
chronicler, who knew so much, and who was
so fond of relating even fabulous histories,
has made no mention whatever of the deeds
of William Tell! How is it possible to conceive
that the above-named authors could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
unanimously pass over in silence the historical
fact attributed to William Tell, a fact accompanied
by circumstances so remarkable that
they must have made a strong impression on
every mind? The love of the marvellous is
a characteristic trait of the middle-ages, and
yet the poetical story of William Tell has
left no vestige in the annals of his cotemporaries!
It does not appear in the chronicle
of Zürich of 1479, where even the name of
William Tell is not cited. What must be inferred
from this silence?</p>

<p>If we proceed to examine the circumstances
as they are related by those who have written
of William Tell, we shall find the authors at
variance in their details; contradicting themselves
in their chronology and in the names
of the places where they assert the facts to
have occurred.</p>

<p>In 1836 the professors of philosophy at the
university of Heidelberg proposed the following
subject for literary composition: “To
examine with greater care than Messieurs Kopp
and Ideler have done, into the origin of the
Swiss confederation and into the details given
respecting Gessler and Tell, and to estimate
the sources whence these details have come
down to us.” The university received in
answer to this proposition a memoir which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
obtained a prize, and which was published by
the author, Ludwig Häusser, in 1840.</p>

<p>Of all the works that have appeared on
this subject this is the most complete and
the most valuable. To a great acquaintance
with the historical literature of Switzerland,
M. Häusser unites that spirit of criticism
without which it is impossible to distinguish
truth from fiction. The following are the
conclusions arrived at by M. Häusser from
his researches. 1) There is nothing to justify
the historical importance that is commonly
attached to William Tell. He has no right
to the title of deliverer of Switzerland, seeing
that he took no active part in the freedom
of the Waldstätter. 2) The existence of a
Swiss named William Tell is without doubt.
It is probable that this man made himself
remarkable by some bold exploit, but
one not in any way connected with the history
of the confederation. 3) As for the
tradition as it is preserved in ballads and
chronicles, it is only supported by such evidence
as is unworthy of credit. It is easy to
demonstrate that the particulars related in
this tradition are not authentic, and that they
are pure inventions of the imagination. In
short, the story of the apple shot from the
head of the child is of Scandinavian origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>Monsieur J. Hisely has summed up the
whole discussion on the subject of William
Tell in his <i>Recherches Critiques</i>, published at
Lausanne in 1843.</p>

<p>In the historico-critical treatise of Julius
Ludwig Ideler (Berlin 1836), the author says
that there exists no record of incontestable
authenticity referring to the romantic incident
of Tell’s life. The chapel near Flüelen, on
the borders of the lake, was only constructed
in 1388: the chapel at Burglen, on the spot
where Tell’s house formerly stood, dates back
to the same time, and there is no written
document to prove that they were built to
commemorate any share taken by Tell in the
emancipation of Switzerland.</p>

<p>The stone fountain at Altdorf<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> which bore the
name of Tell, and above which was seen the
statue of Tell, and of his son with an apple
placed upon his head, was only constructed in
1786, when the tradition had already been
singularly shaken by critical researches.</p>

<p>Ideler adds, that Tell’s lime-tree in the
centre of the market place at Altdorf (Tellenlinde),
and his crossbow preserved in the arsenal
at Zürich, are not more valid proofs
than the pieces of the true cross which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
exhibited in a thousand places, or the handkerchief
of St. Veronica, that is said to be
the real original.</p>

<p>A critic whom it is also important to read
on this question, is Hisely, in his investigations
into the sources whence the Swiss writers have
drawn the history of William Tell. He explains
at length the reasons that make him
consider the absolute silence of Jean de Winterthür
and of Conrad Justinger as an inexplicable
enigma.</p>

<p>Hisely has pursued his researches without
being prejudiced for or against the popular
faith, but the result tends to show how little
foundation there is for the story.</p>

<p>In conclusion we will cite the legends analogous
to the circumstance of the apple shot
in twain by William Tell.</p>


<p class="c large">ENDRIDE PANSA, OR THE SPLAY-FOOTED.</p>

<p class="c less">(A LEGEND OF THE 10TH CENTURY.)</p>

<p>The king of Norway went to pay a visit
to Endride, a young pagan whom he wished
to convert to Christianity. After they had
drank together, and before setting out for the
chase, the king said to Endride: “I wish to
see which of us two is the best marksman.”
“I consent,” said Endride. They entered a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
neighbouring forest. The king took off his
cloak, fixed a long piece of wood in the
ground at a considerable distance, which was
to serve as a mark to the two archers. He
then bent his bow and aimed so accurately
that the arrow hit the top of the wood and
remained fixed in it. All the spectators were
in admiration at the dexterity of the king.
Endride at first asked to be excused from
shooting; but the king refused, and Endride,
being forced to obey, shot, and planted his
arrow in that of the king, so that they were
embedded the one in the other. The king,
evidently piqued, said to Endride: “In truth
thy skill is remarkable, but this trial is not
decisive. Let thy sister’s son be brought, on
whom thou hast once said all thy affections
are concentrated. Let him serve as a mark
for us, and let one of the chessmen be placed
upon the head of the child.” The boy was
brought and fastened to a stake. “We are
going,” said the king to his rival, “to bring
down this chessman from the head of the
child without hurting him.” “Make the trial,
if such is your good pleasure,” replied Endride;
“but if you touch the boy, I will avenge him.”</p>

<p>The king ordered the eyes of the child to
be bandaged, made the sign of the cross, and
blessed the point of the arrow before shooting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
The countenance of Endride became flushed
with emotion. The dart flew, and the historian
Thormod Torfæus, who recites the fact,
adds that Olaf shot off the chessman without
doing the least injury to the child.</p>

<p>The saga goes on to relate that Endride,
overcome with admiration at the skill of the
king, yielded to his wishes, was baptised and
was received as a welcome guest at the court
of Olaf.</p>


<p class="c large">ADVENTURES OF HEMING.</p>

<p>Harold Hardrade, king of Norway (1047-1066),
went one day to visit Aslak, a rich
peasant of the isle of Torg, which forms part
of the group of the islands of Heligoland,
and made acquaintance with Heming, son of
the opulent islander. Aslak, who distrusted
his guest, sought to get rid of him as soon
as possible; he came therefore at the end of
the second day to tell Harold that his vessel
was ready to sail. But the king replied, that
he intended to pass yet another day on the
island. He then betook himself to the forest,
there to contend for the honour of victory in
shooting with the crossbow. Although Harold
was a skilful archer, he could not equal his
rival. Irritated, and desirous to avenge this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
affront, the king ordered Heming, under pain
of death, to hit with his arrow a nut placed
upon the head of his brother Biörn. At first
Heming refused to obey so barbarous an
order; but, yielding at length to the entreaties
of his brother, he begged the king to place
himself by the side of Biörn, in order to
ascertain the result of the trial. But Harold
made Odd Ofeigsön take that place, and he
himself remained close to Heming. The latter,
having made the sign of the cross and invoked
the vengeance of heaven upon the oppressor,
drew his bow and shot the nut placed on the
head of Biörn.</p>

<p>The saga relates that the tyranny of Harold
excited the islanders to revolt, and that Heming,
having taken refuge in England, was
present in the English army at the battle of
Standfordbridge in 1066. The Norwegian king,
at the first shock of the two armies, was struck
by an arrow that pierced his throat.</p>


<p class="c large">ADVENTURE OF PALNATOKE, OR TOKO.</p>

<p>This legend is to be found in the <i>History
of Denmark by Saxo Grammaticus</i>. He has
drawn his recitals from oral tradition and
ancient ballads. This author died in 1204.
It appears that the adventure of Toko must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
have taken place under the reign of Harold of
the Black Tooth; that is to say about 950.</p>

<p>A certain Toko, attached for some time
to the service of the king, had excited the
jealousy of his companions in arms by his
valour and his exploits. One day, during a
banquet, Toko boasted that with the first flight
of his arrow he would bring down from a
distance an apple placed on the end of a
staff. His curious companions related the circumstance
to the king, adding to it remarks
insulting to himself. Harold, whose wicked
disposition was irritated by the discourse of
his flatterers, ordered Toko to perform what
he had boasted himself capable of doing,
taking for a mark an apple placed on the
head of his child. He added, that if he did
not succeed on the first attempt, his vanity
should cost him his life. The imminence of
the danger strengthened the courage of Toko.
After placing his child, the intrepid warrior
impressed upon him the necessity of remaining
motionless when he should hear the hissing
of the arrow; and, having taken the measures
dictated by prudence, he made him turn his
head aside, lest he should be frightened at the
sight of the weapon his father was aiming at
him. Then Toko took three arrows, fixed one
in his bow, and hit the apple at the first trial.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
The king asking Toko what he had intended
to do with the two remaining arrows, the
archer replied: “If my arm had failed me,
the second arrow should have pierced thy
heart, and the third, that of the first audacious
man who dared to advance a step.” The king,
concealing his resentment, subjected Toko to
other trials, and he, cursing Harold, sought
out Svend, the son of Harold, who was arming
to make war against his father. One day,
having surprised the king behind a bush, he
revenged himself for all the outrages he had
endured, by letting fly at him an arrow which
inflicted a mortal wound.</p>

<p>Olaüs Magnus also relates this story, which
is not surprising, seeing that he has sometimes
copied word for word from <i>Saxo Grammaticus</i>.
He confesses, moreover, that he has
borrowed from his predecessor.</p>


<p class="c large">ADVENTURES OF EGIL.</p>

<p>If from Scandinavia we pass into Iceland,
we there find the legend of the apple transmitted
to us by the Vilkina-Saga, in the 14th
century.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Egil, the brother of Veland
the smith, came to the court of king
Nidung. Egil excelled in the art of handling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the bow and the crossbow. His address excited
admiration throughout the country. The
king Nidung gave Egil a good reception, and
put his skill more than once to the proof.
After having exhausted all the resources of
his imagination, he took it into his head to
have an apple placed upon the head of the
son of Egil. “From where thou standest,”
said he to the archer, “thou must shoot down
this apple.” Egil took an arrow from his
quiver, tried its point, and laid it by his
side. He then took a second arrow, rested
it on the string of his bow, took aim, and
struck the apple in such a manner that the
arrow and the apple both fell to the ground.
This trial of skill still lives in the memory
of the people. King Nidung then asked Egil
why he had taken two arrows, since he had
been ordered to hit the apple at one trial.
“Sire,” replied Egil, “I will tell you the truth,
whatever may be the consequence. This arrow
was destined for you, if I had wounded my
son.” The king admired the frankness of this
reply, and was not offended by it, acknowledging
the cruelty of the order he had
given.</p>

<p>All the spectators agreed that it was the
speech of a worthy and brave man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>


<p class="c large">ADVENTURE OF WILLIAM OF<br>
CLOUDESLY.</p>

<p>The large forests of England were for many
years formidable to the Normans. They were
inhabited by the last remnants of the Saxon
armies, who still disputing the conquest, persisted
in leading a life opposed to the laws
of the invader. Every where driven out,
pursued, hunted like wild beasts, they here,
favoured by the shelter of the forests, had
been able to maintain themselves in force,
under a sort of military organisation.</p>

<p>Among the chief outlaws, Adam Bel, Clym
of the Clough, and William of Cloudesly, were
not the least celebrated. Bound together by
the same destiny, they had taken an oath of
fraternity, as was customary in the 12th century.
Adam and Clym were not married, but
William had a wife and three children, whom
he had left at Carlisle. One day he resolved
to visit them. He set off in spite of the
counsels of his companions, and arrived at
night in the city: but being recognised by an
old woman, he was denounced to the magistrate,
his house was surrounded, he was made
prisoner, and a gallows was erected in the
market-place on which to hang him. A young
swine-herd informed Adam and Clym of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
fate of their brother in arms. The sentence
was about to be executed, when the two friends
of the condemned man appeared in the market-place,
and a sanguinary combat ensued, which
terminated in the delivery of the prisoner.
The three outlaws, however, worn out at
length with their wandering life, decided upon
making their submission. They arrived in
London with the eldest son of William of
Cloudesly, entered the king’s palace without
uttering a word to any one, proceeded into
the hall, and, kneeling on one knee, raised
their hands and said. “Sire, deign to pardon
us.” “What are your names?” demanded the
king. “Adam Bel, Clym of the Clough, and William
of Cloudesly.” “Ah, you are then those
brigands of whom I have heard? I swear to
God, you shall all three be hung!” They were
immediately arrested by the king’s order; but
the queen, moved by the unhappy fate of these
three men who had voluntarily surrendered
themselves, interceded for them and obtained
their pardon, but on condition that they
should be victorious in a shooting match with
the king’s archers.</p>

<p>Two branches of a hazel tree were fixed in
the ground in a field at a distance of twenty
times twenty paces. None of the king’s men
at arms could hit this mark. “I will try,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
said William, and he bent his bow and took
so true an aim that the arrow split the
branch. “Thou art the best archer that I
have seen in the whole course of my life,”
said the astonished king. “To please my
sovereign lord,” said William, “I would do
something still more surprising. I have a son
of the age of seven years: I love this son
with an extreme tenderness: I will attach him
to a post in the presence of every one, I will
place an apple upon his head, and at the
distance of a hundred and twenty paces I
will pierce the apple without wounding the
child.” “I take thee at thy word,” said the
king; “but if thou failest, thou shalt be hung.”
“What I have promised,” said William, “I will
perform.” He fixed a stake in the ground,
fastened his son to it, and, having made him
turn away his head, placed the apple upon it.
After taking these precautions, William went
to a distance of a hundred and twenty paces,
bent his bow, besought all present to keep
strict silence, and let fly the arrow, which
pierced the apple without touching the child.
“God preserve me from ever serving as an
aim to thee!” exclaimed the king. The skilful
archer, his brethren in arms, and his wife and
children, were conducted to the court, where
the king and queen loaded them with favours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>This trial of skill of William of Cloudesly
still dwells in the memory of the people.
Several English poets make mention of the
fact, and the old English ballad has furnished
Sir Walter Scott with many particulars of
the scene of the archery meeting in Ivanhoe.</p>

<p>Let us here conclude, only making the
remark, that at the end of the <i>Recherches
critiques sur l’histoire de Guillaume Tell</i>, by J.
J. Hisely, this author has quoted the documents,
so called authentic, which the supporters
of this story have published; and he
has also made mention of the chapel built on
the Lake of Lucerne, to the memory it is
said, of William Tell.</p>

<p>Hisely also shows that none of these alleged
proofs stand the test of strict examination,
and that some of the documents are
even forgeries.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c7">PETRARCH AND LAURA.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1325.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">Petrarch</span> was born at Arezzo in 1304. His
father Petracco sent his son at an early age
to study law at Bologna, but an irresistible
passion for poetry, which soon shewed itself,
led him to neglect more profitable studies
for the works of the poets and philosophers
of antiquity. At 22 years of age Francesco
di Petracco (for such was his name) had lost
both father and mother, and was left without
the means of subsistence. He took up his
abode with his brother Gherardo at Avignon,
the last residence of his father, and instead of
striving to increase their very small income
by entering upon some lucrative profession,
Francesco spent his whole time in reading
Virgil, Cicero, Horace, and <i>tutti quanti</i>.</p>

<p>One morning early, as Petrarca (the name
he had now adopted, probably out of vanity)
entered the church of the nuns of Santa Clara,
he was struck, say his biographers, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
dazzling beauty of a young girl, by the sweet
expression of her face, the grace of her form,
and the tastefulness of her costume.</p>

<p>Her eyes were blue, say some; they were
black, say others; and the reader will see presently
that this is not the only point on
which opinions differed. This beauty was
Laura, or Loretta de Noves, or de Sade, or
Desbaux; for there is great uncertainty even
regarding her name. Petrarca, we are told,
took her for his ideal. He may really have
been in love with her, or he may only have
conformed to the fashion of those days, when
poets were in the habit of selecting some
imaginary object for their devotion and adoring
it in a poetical sense. Thus was it with Cavalcanti,
Montemagno and Cino da Pistoja,
whose Mandetta, Lauretta, and Selvaggia were
only poetical fictions and so was it in fact
with Dante himself, whose Beatrice was a
child who died at nine years of age. Thomas
Keightley, in his <i>Tales and Popular Fictions</i>,
and other English authors, adopt the
latter sceptical opinion. “I confess,” says
Keightley, “that I am not indisposed to
regard the Beatrice of Dante, the Laura of
Petrarca, the Fiammetta of Boccacio, and all
those ladies with significant names, who were
all first seen in passion week, and whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
lovers all survived them, as being more the
creatures of air and of romance than of real
flesh and blood.”</p>

<p>Petrarca, at the time we speak of, was twenty-three
years of age; and, after composing a great
number of sonnets to his lady-love, he left
Avignon, went to Paris, and travelled through
France, Flanders, Brabant and Germany. It
has been remarked as a strange coincidence,
that during his absence he wrote only four
letters to Avignon, and but one to Laura.
Ginguené, in his <i>Literary History of Italy</i>, has
collected from the works of Petrarca a few
stray sentences on his mistress, but the poet
gives no particulars of her life, and, neither
in his Italian nor in his Latin compositions,
does he speak of the family of his beloved,
although she is almost the sole subject of his
songs.</p>

<p>It is not then to be wondered at if his
later biographers are left in the dark about
Laura, notwithstanding that contemporary authors
must have been acquainted both with
the lover and with his mistress.</p>

<p>Baldelli, a very partial commentator on
Petrarca, is obliged to confess that the poet
was by no means faithful to his divinity; but
that another, whom he loved after a less ideal
fashion, presented him with a daughter, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
afterwards became the consolation of his old
age. “<i>Francesco nei passati falli ricadde, e dal
suo commercio con femina impura ebbe una figlia
appellata Francesca che fu poscia tenera compagna
e fedel sostegno di sua vecchiezza. La
madre fu rapita da morte dopo la nascita di
Francesca, con grand dolore di Petrarca.</i>”</p>

<p>The Abbé de Sade, in his learned researches
upon Laura, shows, that besides this daughter,
the poet had a son named Giovanno. This
young man was legitimatised by Pope Clement
VI. in 1348; and in the papal brief he is
mentioned as the son of unmarried parents:
<i>De soluto et solutâ</i>.</p>

<p>Baldelli believes that both children were
by the same mother. Francesco Petrarca, who
is characterised by Voltaire as a genius eminent
for his constant repetition of the same
thing, died in 1374, aged seventy.</p>

<p>Nearly a century after his death, in 1471,
an anonymous author, in a <i>Vita di Francesco
Petrarca</i>, pretended that Pope Urbanus V.,
with whom the poet was an especial favourite,
wished to give him Laura in marriage, but
that Petrarca declined, saying that the fountain
from which he drew his amorous inspiration
for the composition of his sonnets,
would fail him entirely were he to be united
to the object of this love: “<i>E quantunque gli</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
<i>volse essere data per donna, ad instanza di
Papa Urbano quinto, il quale lui singularmente
amava, concedendogli di tener colla donna i
beneficii insieme, nol volse mai consentire, dicendo
che il frutto che prendea dell’ amore, a
scrivere, di poi che la cosa amata consequito
avesse, tutto si perderia.</i>”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the improbability of this
confession, seeing that Pope Urbanus did not
mount the pontifical throne until after the
death of Laura, we may still infer from it
that in the first years of the 15th century a
very exalted opinion was not entertained of
the sincerity of Petrarca’s passion. The mention
of all these circumstances, no doubt instigated
Tomasini, who was the most devoted
of Petrarch’s biographers, and who looked
upon the poet almost as a saint, to adduce
a reason for his remaining unmarried to the
end of his life. “He believed,” says he, “that
marriage would extinguish his love.” “<i>Censebat
nempè isto nexu amoris puritatem obfuscatam iri,
neque cultum animi ita fore constantem, juxta
illud Tibulli: Semper in absentes felicior æstus
amantis.</i>”</p>

<p>In 1539 Squarciafico and Nicolò Franco attacked
with much humour the morals and
the life of Laura’s adorer. Ercole Giannini
followed in the same vein; and the circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
we have already mentioned tend to
prove, that although Petrarca may have been
a great poet, a great politician, a savant, and
a prolific writer, there is more than one reason
for believing that he was not altogether the
Platonic lover some have represented him
to be.</p>

<p>With regard to Laura all is doubt, obscurity,
and hypothesis. The traces left of her
were so faint, even in the century in which
she lived, that Baldelli says that doubts were
even entertained of her existence. “<i>Tanto
s’oscurò la sua memoria, che nei due secoli in
cui l’Italia negli enti allegorici e di ragione,
andava smarrita, alcuni dubitarono della esistenza
di lui.</i>” (See <i>Petrarca e sue opere</i>.)</p>

<p>The Abbé de Sade, in his memoirs on the
life of this poet, says also, that in Italy the
beautiful Laura was supposed to be an allegorical
personage.</p>

<p>The endeavours made by Alexandre Vellutello
and others to establish her existence,
led to no positive results; for in the certificated
of birth from the years 1307 to 1324,
the name of Laura, although frequently met
with, can never in any one instance be applied
to Petrarca’s mistress.</p>

<p>Vellutello tries to make her out the daughter
of Henri Chiabau, a seigneur of Cabrières,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Monsieur de Bimard in his <i>Mémoires</i>, pretends
that her father was Raybau de Raimond; the
Abbé Castaing, of Avignon, published in 1819
a new view, and maintained that Petrarca’s
divinity was a certain Laura Des Beaux, and
that his devotion to her was purely Platonic.
The Abbé de Sade tries to prove that she
was the daughter of Audibert de Noves.</p>

<p>Some assert that Laura never married, and
died a virgin: according to others she was
married at fourteen years of age to Hugues
de Sade, a nobleman hard to please and given
to jealousy, and that she bore him eleven
children, nine of whom survived their mother.</p>

<p>If, on the one hand, Laura has been considered
a myth, many writers, on the other
hand, say that she was far from insensible to
the passion of Petrarca. Her reputation is
lightly treated in a manuscript written by
Luigi Peruzsi, of which Mr. Bruce-Whyte
has made use in his <i>Histoire des Langues Romanes</i>.
This view of her character gave rise
to a very interesting article in a newspaper
of Vaucluse entitled: “<i>L’Écho de Vaucluse</i>,”
of the 11th September 1842. We can nowhere
find any authentic testimony nor any
decisive evidence wherewith to dissipate doubts
or to confirm assertions on this subject.</p>

<p>There are three portraits of Laura extant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
all of which differ materially in features and
in costume. In 1339, Simon of Sienna, who
was employed to decorate the episcopal palace
at Avignon, is said to have painted Laura’s
portrait, and to have presented it to Petrarca,
with whom he was intimate.</p>

<p>Richard de Sade brought another portrait
from Avignon to Rome, and gave it to Cardinal
Barberini. It has no resemblance whatever
to the first. The third is in a manuscript
at Florence.</p>

<p>Marsand in a special dissertation on these
portraits, rejects the two first and only admits
the latter, engraved by the celebrated
Morghen. Here again we are met by doubt
and obscurity.</p>

<p>In the French Imperial Library, there are
two manuscripts of the 15th century containing
a Latin treatise by Petrarca: <i>De contemptu
Mundi</i>, which apparently affirms that
Laura was the mother of several children, as
above stated. In this treatise we read that
she gradually approaches her end, and that
her lovely form has suffered much from her
frequent confinements: “<i>Morbis ac crebris partubus
exhaustum, multum pristini vigoris amisit
corpus illud egregium.</i>”</p>

<p>In the work of Olivier Vitalis, published
in Paris in 1842, which contains researches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
into almost every opinion concerning Laura
and Petrarca, that of her marriage is rejected:
“<i>Des couches fréquentes</i>,” says the author, “<i>des
chagrins domestiques peuvent convenir et s’appliquer
à la Laure de De Sade, mais non à la
Laure célébrée par Pétrarque, qui mourut dans
le célibat</i>.”</p>

<p>Several Italian authors declare on the other
hand that the objection against Laura’s celibacy
is made by Petrarch himself, who, in his
Latin Dialogue with St. Augustin, frequently
makes use of the word <i>mulier</i>, in speaking
of her. The dictionary of Vanieri, and others,
tell us that: “<i>Fæmina propriè sexum significat,
mulier quæ virgo non est.</i>”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our poet, in all matters appertaining
to his mistress, has intentionally,
or by chance, only very vaguely mentioned,
by allusions, or by figures of speech, dates or
circumstances bearing reference to her. Besides
the striking difference that exists on
many points in the manuscripts which have
served as foundations for the various editions
of Petrarca, it must be confessed that nowhere
have primary and incontrovertible facts been
produced on which to ground a true and
faithful biography of Laura.</p>

<p>It is stated that an allusion to Laura’s
death, and burial at Avignon, is to be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
in a manuscript Virgil which belonged to
Petrarca, and which is preserved in the <i>Bibliotheca
Ambrosiana</i> at Milan; but learned
critics, among whom we may name Alexander
Tassoni, one of the most reliable authors of
Italy, A. Vellutello, and others, consider this
note as very apocryphal, and even as a forgery:
for the writing has never been proved
to be that of the poet, and moreover this
memorandum is in open contradiction with
the sonnets of Petrarca written on the spot
where the lovers first met.</p>

<p>It was not until towards the beginning of
the 16th century that the desire sprang up
among the Italians to know who the Laura
really was, that had been the theme of song
for twenty years. Alexander Vellutello made
two journeys to Avignon for the express purpose
of collecting information regarding her,
and from that time innumerable discussions
arose from all quarters. Tomasini, Maria
Suarez, G. Ferrari, F. Orsino, Muratori, &amp;c., on
the one side, and Vellutello, Gesualdo, Tassoni,
le Bastie, &amp;c. on the other. But they were
all staggered by a remark made by Giacomo
Colonna, Bishop of Lombez, with whom Petrarca
lived for some time, and who consequently
must have known him intimately.
The bishop writes: “Your Laura is only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
phantom of your imagination on whom you exercise
your muse. <i>Un nome imaginario di Laura
per avere un oggetto di cui ragionare.</i>”</p>

<p>Amid such a multiplicity of conflicting
opinions where can reliance be placed!</p>

<p>In 1529, one hundred and eighty years after
the death of Laura, a pretended discovery of her
tomb was made at Avignon; but Olivier Vitalis<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
proves the utter fallacy of this discovery,
and shows the absurdity of the explanation
given in support of it. This tomb is almost
universally acknowledged to have been devoid,
both inside and out, of any trace of the name of
the defunct, or any date of her decease. The
tomb itself was destroyed in the French revolution,
and at the present day no vestige
of it remains.</p>

<p>We see then that this enigmatical Laura
has made far more noise in the world during
the last four or five centuries, than she ever
did in her own time. Perhaps contemporary
writers were well aware, as some have asserted,
that Petrarch’s sonnets were mere poetical
fictions as far as Laura was concerned. Had
it been otherwise, more would surely have
transpired about her during her lifetime.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
But on the contrary, her existence is even
now thought to be so problematical, that the
author of the article on <i>Laura</i>, in Didot’s
<i>Biographie Générale</i>, refrains from giving an
opinion on the question.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c8">EXECUTION OF JEANNE D’ARC.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1431.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">History</span> relates that Jeanne d’Arc was led
to the stake the last day but one of May
1431, and burnt alive by a slow fire, and her
bones and ashes thrown into the Seine.</p>

<p>When, in the 15th and 16th centuries, the
memory of Jeanne d’Arc revived in the minds
of historians, the subject invariably served as
a theme for controversy and discussion. It is
well known that Charles VII., to reward the
bravery of this exalted heroine, bestowed letters
of nobility upon her brothers and their
descendants. Documents discovered by the
learned Père Vignier have led to the supposition
that Jeanne d’Arc subsequently married,
and was not therefore burnt at Rouen,
as is commonly believed, but that some other
poor unknown creature was sacrificed in her
stead. This opinion, which sounds paradoxical,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
is nevertheless supported by weighty evidence.</p>

<p>Father Vignier of the Oratory, a learned
and zealous philobiblon, ever in pursuit of
literary discoveries, of which so many are due
to the institution of the Oratory, found during
a visit to Metz, while turning over the archives
of that city, the following notice, in
a manuscript register of the events that had
taken place there during the 15th century:
“In the year 1436, Messire Phlin Marcou was
sheriff of Metz, and on the 20th day of May
of the aforesaid year, came the maid Jeanne,
who had been in France, to la Grange of
Ormes, near St. Privé, and was taken there
to confer with any one of the sieurs of Metz,
and she called herself Claude; and on the
same day there came to see her there her two
brothers, one of whom was a knight and was
called Messire Pierre, and the other “petit
Jehan” a squire, and they thought that she
had been burnt, but as soon as they saw her
they recognised her, and she them. And on
Monday the 21st day of the said month they
took their sister with them to Boquelon, and
the sieur Nicole, being a knight, gave her a
stout stallion, of the value of thirty francs, and
a pair of saddle cloths; the sieur Aubert Boulle,
a riding hood; the sieur Nicole Grognet a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
sword; and the said maiden mounted the said
horse nimbly, and said several things to the
sieur Nicole by which he well understood that
it was she who had been in France; and she
was recognised by many tokens to be the
maid Jeanne of France who escorted king
Charles to Reims, and several declared that
she had been burnt in Normandy, and she
spoke mostly in parables. She afterwards returned
to the town of Marnelle for the feast
of Pentecost, and remained there about three
weeks, and then set off to go to Notre Dame
d’Alliance. And when she wished to leave,
several of Metz went to see her at the said
Marnels and gave her several jewels, and they
knew well that she was the maid Jeanne of
France; and she then went to Erlon in the
Duchy of Luxembourg, where she was thronged,
so much so that the son of the count of Wuenbourg
took her to Cologne near his father the
count de Wuenbourg, and the said count loved
her greatly, and when she wished to come
away he had a handsome cuirass made for
her to equip her therein; and then she came
to the aforesaid Erlon and there was solemnised
the marriage of Monsieur de Hermoise
knight, and the said maid Jeanne, and afterwards
the said sieur Hermoise with his wife
the maid, came to live at Metz in the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
the said sieur had, opposite Saint Seglenne,
and remained there until it pleased them to
depart.”</p>

<p>Since the discovery made by Père Vignier,
this remarkable document has been inserted
in a work entitled: <i>Chronique de Metz, composé
par le doyen de Saint Thiebaut de la même
ville</i>. This chronicle terminates at the year
1445.</p>

<p>Vignier might not probably have put much
faith in this manuscript, had it not been supported
by a proof which he considered of
great weight. As he was very popular among
the best families of Lorraine, he frequently
visited them, and being one day at dinner
with M. des Armoises, member of an old and
illustrious race, the conversation fell on the
genealogy of this nobleman, who told the
learned father that among the family archives
he would find much information regarding his
ancestors. Dinner was therefore no sooner
ended than the keys of the chamber containing
these musty papers were given to
Vignier, and he spent the remainder of the
day in looking over numerous old manuscripts
and parchments. At length he fell upon a
contract of marriage between one Robert des
Armoises, chevalier, with Jeanne d’Arcy, the
so called Maid of Orleans. I leave the reader<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
to imagine the surprise of father Vignier at
this unexpected confirmation of the manuscript
register.</p>

<p>This historical novelty excited a great sensation
at the time, as may easily be supposed.
The above extract was inserted in the before
mentioned chronicle, and Dom Calmet placed
it among the printed documents in his <i>History
of Lorraine</i>.</p>

<p>The circumstance had been nearly forgotten,
when, towards the year 1740, a member of
the literary society of Orleans, while making
some researches among the archives in the
town-hall, found a bill of Jacques l’Argentier,
in which in the years 1435 and 1436 there is
mention of a sum of eleven panes eight cents
for refreshments supplied to the messenger
who had brought letters from the maid of
Orleans; and another sum of twelve livres,
given by the magistrates on the 21st August
1436 to John du Lis, brother to the maid of
Orleans, to help him to pay his journey back
to his sister. He had an audience of the king,
who had granted him a donation of one hundred
francs.</p>

<p>Here is a third extract, even more remarkable
than the former: “<i>Au Sieur du Lis, le 18 Octobre
1436, pour un voyage qu’il fit en la dite
ville, en route vers la Pucelle, qui se trouvant</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
<i>alors à Arlon, au Luxembourg, et pour port de
letters de Jeanne la Pucelle, pour le Roi, à
Loicher, où il résidait alors, six livres parisis.</i>”</p>

<p>And again: “<i>A. Renard Brune, le 25 Juillet
1435, au soir, pour faire loire un messager qui
apportait lettres de Jeanne la Pucelle et allait
devers Guillaume Belier, Bailly de Troyes,
II. s. 83. Parisis.</i>”</p>

<p>The reader must remember that immediately
after the execution of Jeanne d’Arc, there
was a common rumour that she was not dead,
and that another victim had been substituted
for her. In the <i>Histoire de Lorraine</i> by Dom
Calmet, which only extends to 1544, we read,
speaking of the siege of Compiègne, that the
Maid of Orleans escaped in the crowd, and
that no one knew what became of her. Some
supposed her to have been captured and carried
to Rouen and burnt, others affirm that
the army was averse to her death.</p>

<p>The chronicle of Metz is still more explicit.
After relating the capture of Jeanne d’Arc, her
removal to Rouen, and her death at the stake,
the author adds: “It was so asserted, but since
that time a contrary opinion has been held.”</p>

<p>Pasquier, in his researches on France, declares,
that during four whole years he had
in his keeping the original trial of the maid
of Orleans with all the attendant circumstances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
and he introduced the subject into
chapter V. book VI. of his history. His opinion
then should be treated with consideration. He
observes that the inexplicable delay between
the condemnation and execution, and still
more the extraordinary precautions that were
taken to hide the victim from the eyes of the
public, are very remarkable. When she was
led to the stake, a large mitre was placed on
her head, which concealed the greater part of
her face, and a huge frame, covered with insulting
phrases, was carried before her, and
completely concealed her person.</p>

<p>In 1440, the people so firmly believed that
Jeanne d’Arc was still alive, and that another
had been sacrificed in her place, that an adventuress
who endeavoured to pass herself off
as the Maid of Orleans was ordered by the
government to be exposed before the public
on the marble stone of the palace hall, in order
to prove that she was an impostor. Why were
not such measures taken against the real Maid
of Orleans, who is mentioned in so many public
documents, and who took no pains to hide
herself?</p>

<p>The king of France not only ennobled Jeanne
d’Arc, her father, brothers, and their descendants
male and female, by letters patent dated
1429, but moreover wished that her brothers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
should take the surname of de Lys, and in
fact we find this name in the registers already
quoted.</p>

<p>A very remarkable extract given by Pasquier
is drawn from the accounts of the auditor
of the Orleans estate, in the year 1444
(observe the date). An island on the river
Loire is restored to a brother of the Maid
of Orleans, Pierre de Lys, chevalier: “<i>Quie la
supplication de Messire Pierre, contenant que pour
acquitter la loyauté envers le Roi notre seigneur
et Monsieur le Duc d’Orléans, il se partit de
son pays pour venir au service du Roi et de
Monsieur le Duc, en la compagnie de Jeanne la
Pucelle sa seur, avec la quelle, jusques à son
absentement et depuis jusques à présent, il a
exposé son corps et ses biens au dit service et
au fait des guerres du Roi, tant à la résistance
des anciens ennemis du Royaume qui tinrent le
siège devant la ville d’Orléans, comme en plusieurs
voyages faits et entrepris pour le Roi, &amp;c.</i>”</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to observe here how
very much stronger the claims of this brother
would have been, if in 1444, instead of saying
“<i>jusques à son absentement</i>,” he had brought forward
the martyrdom of this sister, as having
been the means of saving France from the
yoke of England. The expression <i>son absentement</i>
may, easily be explained when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
remember that the Duke of Bedford, regent
of France, died in 1435, and that most probably
Jeanne d’Arc was released from prison
after this event. It was only one year later
that she married Robert des Armoises.</p>

<p>But we may be told that Pope Calixtus III.
appointed in 1455 a commission to inquire into
the justice or injustice of the condemnation of
the maid of Orleans, and that more than a
hundred witnesses were heard during this examination
without the question of the reality
of her execution being once raised. Father
Vignier has met this objection by observing
that the committee of enquiry was desired to
examine exclusively whether the judges had
been justified in condemning her as a heretic
and an apostate, and it was on this point
only that the inquiry touched.</p>

<p>The commission was by no means ignorant
of the received opinion that Jeanne d’Arc
still lived, but they were bound to keep to
the letter of the instructions received.</p>

<p>Jules Quicherat has collected almost every
item bearing upon the doubt of the fate of
Jeanne d’Arc, in the fifth volume of his
work: <i>Procès de condamnation et de réhabilitation
de Jeanne d’Arc</i> (in 8ᵛᵒ. Paris 1849). 1) He
gives the entire extract from the chronicle of
Metz. 2) The extract from the audited accounts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
of the city of Orleans for the year
1436, according to the register preserved in
the Orleans library. 3) An extract from the
contract of sale of the fourth part of the lordship
of Haraucourt by Robert des Armoises
and Jeanne du Lys, called la Pucelle, his wife.
4) Other extracts from the accounts kept by
the city of Orleans and the city of Tours for
presents of wine made to the Pucelle, and
expense of postage of letters from the Bailly
of Tournay to the king, touching the matter
of Dame Jeanne des Armoises.</p>

<p>Quicherat does not admit that this Jeanne
was the true Pucelle, but those who read all
his authorities will still retain strong doubts
on the subject.</p>

<p>In the 4th volume of the same work we
find the account of the execution of Jeanne
according to the chronicle of Perceval de
Cagny, whom M. Quicherat considers to be
the most complete, the best informed, and
the most honest of all the historians of “la
Pucelle.”</p>

<p>This Perceval was in the service of the Duc
d’Alençon who had constant intercourse with
the maid of Orleans and had the best opportunities
of observing and knowing her. It
was in 1436 that Perceval occupied himself
in committing the facts to writing, only five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
years after the execution at Rouen. Now he
asserts that the victim’s face was covered when
walking to the stake, while at the same time
a spot had been chosen for the execution, that
permitted the populace to have a good view.
Why this contradiction? A place is chosen
to enable the people to see everything, but
the victim<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is carefully hidden from their
sight. Does it not seem as if this was arranged
with a sinister intention?</p>

<p>The following words are from the chronicle:
“<i>Les gens de la justice du Roi d’Angleterre et
la dite ville de Rouen firent appareiller lieu convenable
pour exécuter la justice, qui peult être
vu de très grand peuple. Et le dit 24ⁱᵉᵐᵉ jour de
May environ l’eure de midy, la pucelle fut amenée
du Chastel, le visage embronché (recouvert) au dit
lieu ou le feu estoit prest; et après autres choses
lues en la ditte place, elle fut liée à l’estache
et arse, par le rapport de ceux, qui disent ce
avoir vu.</i>”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c9">THE MURDER OF THE COUNTESS
OF CHATEAUBRIAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1525.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> tragical death of the Countess of Chateaubriand
is one of the most remarkable
traditions of Brittany.</p>

<p>Go in the present day to Chateaubriand,
that feudal city whose duke rendered homage
to the Duke of Brittany alone. Let yourself
be conducted to the castle, now transformed
into the town-hall, with a tricolor flag waving
over the dilapidated arms of the Sires of
Chateaubriand. Question the first person you
meet, be it a young woman or child: either
will relate to you with an air of unalterable
conviction the tragical fate of Françoise de
Foix, assassinated by her husband Jean, Count
of Chateaubriand. No other proofs will be
advanced in support of the murder than the
public belief transmitted from father to son,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
and the traces still visible of the blood of the
victim in the room where the crime was committed.
Follow your guide, who is about to
show you these bloody vestiges, which nearly
three centuries have, it is said, failed to efface.</p>

<p>You mount a staircase the steps of which
are worn by feet; you cross long galleries
and reach at length a vast chamber stript of
its gothic furniture, but still preserving as a
remnant of past splendour decorations of faded
gilt leather, a wainscot of carved oak, and
some painted panels blackened by age. It
is here, you are told, that the Countess remained
a prisoner for several years; it is here
that she breathed her last sigh, exhausted by
the blood that flowed from veins opened in
her hands and feet by order of her husband.</p>

<p>The commandant of the gendarmerie now
inhabits this immense apartment, in which
the vulgarity of the shabby modern furniture
contrasts with the general aspect of the room.
If you question the clerks and servants who
lodge in the interior of the ancient castle, or
are obliged from the nature of their duties
to frequent these spots, they will tell you,
making the sign of the cross, that the soul
of the Countess yearly revisits the place where
she lost her life, on the night of the 24th October,
the anniversary of this cruel act of vengeance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
Many witnesses will be at hand to declare
that they have frequently heard piercing cries
and stifled lamentations issue from the walls
at midnight, the hour at which the Count de
Chateaubriand murdered his wife. The commandant,
nevertheless, we are happy to say,
contrives to sleep remarkably well on the very
scene of the alleged crime.</p>

<p>The story of Françoise de Foix is told as
follows: Endowed with extraordinary beauty,
she was married at the age of twelve years
to the Count of Chateaubriand, who obtained
her hand without difficulty, being content to
receive it with no other dowry than her youth
and loveliness. The young countess in course
of time presented her husband with a daughter,
and his happiness would have been complete
had he been able for an indefinite period to
conceal his treasure in the secluded corner of
Brittany in which they lived. But the reputation
of his wife’s beauty traversed the confines
of the province, and when Francis I.,
King of France, desired that the ladies, who
had until then only appeared at court on state
occasions, should henceforward be introduced
and should take part in all the festivities, one
of the first on whom his thoughts rested was
the Countess of Chateaubriand.</p>

<p>The count for a while evaded the royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
mandate, and laid the blame on the peculiar
temperament of his wife, representing her as
a wild wayward creature whom it was impossible
to subdue.</p>

<p>At length some urgent and unforeseen business
calling the count to Paris, he hit upon
an expedient by which he hoped to escape
the importunity of the king, and at the same
time reserve to himself private communication
with, and control over the actions of, his wife.
He ordered two rings to be made of a peculiar
device, and so exactly similar that they
could not be distinguished the one from the
other. He gave one to the countess, and told
her that during his absence she was not to
put faith in any instructions he might send
her from Paris unless they were accompanied
by his ring enclosed in the letter.</p>

<p>He then parted from her somewhat relieved
in mind, but still anxious and doubtful as to
the result of his precaution. On his arrival
in Paris he was questioned about his wife by
the king, who complained of her absence from
court. The count, to excuse himself, offered
to summon her at once from Brittany, and
even to write to her in the name of Francis I.,
begging her to come immediately to join her
husband. But the letter, unaccompanied by
the ring, produced no effect. At length a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
servant of the count, yielding to the seductions
of a bribe, betrayed his master’s secret. A
duplicate ring was made, and in the next letter
addressed by the count to his wife it was
fraudulently inserted. The young countess
hastened to her husband’s side, and the count’s
stupefaction may be imagined on the sudden
appearance of one he so little expected to see.
She showed him the second ring; he at once
perceived that he had been betrayed, and
feeling sure of the inevitable consequences
under the influence of such a monarch as
Francis I., he took a hasty departure for
Brittany in order to avoid being a witness
to his wife’s shame and his own dishonour.</p>

<p>The countess, after some little resistance,
verified all his apprehensions, and yielded to
the importunities of her royal lover.</p>

<p>For some time she ruled the king absolutely,
and provided handsomely for her three
brothers. Her husband would also have been
raised to some important office in the state,
had he not indignantly refused any such preferment.
He would not even allow his wife’s
name, under any pretext, to be mentioned in
his presence.</p>

<p>On the fall of Francis I., and his imprisonment
after the battle of Pavia, the Countess
of Chateaubriand was thrown upon the mercy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
her husband, who only awaited his opportunity
to revenge himself upon his wife.</p>

<p>On her return to the castle in Brittany,
he refused to see her, and shut her up in
apartments entirely draped in black. He allowed
their little daughter, then seven years
of age, to take her meals with her mother
and to remain with her a part of each day;
but after six months the countess was deprived
of this consolation by the death of her
child, and the count, having no longer this
endearing object before his eyes, to plead for
the mother, gave himself up entirely to the
gratification of his vengeance.</p>

<p>One day he entered the gloomy prison of
his wife accompanied by six men in masks
and by two surgeons. The latter bled the
countess in the arms and feet and then left her
gradually to die. The count took refuge in a
foreign land to escape the pursuit of justice.</p>

<p>Brantôme is the first historian who has
mentioned the private amours of Francis I.
and the Countess of Chateaubriand. Varillas
is the first who published the secret details
of the violent death of this lady. Since then
most historians have regarded the authority
of Brantôme as indisputable, founded as it is
on contemporary opinion and belief, and sanctioned
by the court itself. The details of Varillas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
however, seem to be little better than
a romance, so many errors and inaccuracies
do they contain.</p>

<p>Before we enter upon the discussion of this
tradition let us remark by way of preface,
that the historian Varillas is acknowledged
by all critics to be pre-eminently careless in
verifying the sources from which he draws
his information. He would not even have
deigned to quote the documents on which he
founded his narrative,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> had not his detractors
accused him of having invented the whole of it.</p>

<p>His talent for exaggerating or suppressing
important facts to suit his personal views, is
well known, and as he generally draws from
his own prodigious memory without consulting
references, he often falls into serious and unpardonable
mistakes. His chief error in this
instance is in the date he assigns to the murder
of the Countess of Chateaubriand, viz. the
26th October 1526, when in fact she died on
the 16th October 1537, as we learn from the
inscription on her tomb in the church of the
convent des Mathurins in the town of Chateaubriand.
The count died on the 11th February
1543, and his natural heirs having
instituted a law suit, memorable for its duration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
of half a century, against his donatee,
Anne de Montmorency, the learned Pierre
Hévin, a lawyer of the parliament of Rennes,
published in 1686 a memoir founded on the
original legal documents, in which he triumphantly
refutes the assertions made by Varillas.</p>

<p>The marriage of Françoise de Foix with the
Count of Chateaubriand took place in the course
of the year 1509, and as we have said, they
resided in Brittany until the king called them
to court. Brantôme tells us that the Countess
was appointed lady in waiting to Queen Claude
of France. From the year 1515, her power
over the king was apparent. The alacrity
with which Francis conferred the dignity of
field-marshal on her elder brother leads to
the conclusion that the king sought to obtain
her good graces as soon as he mounted the
throne. Her husband was sent to a military
command in Italy, that grave of many of the
flower of the French nobility during the space
of thirty years, but the count returned to
France safe and sound. Francis being taken
prisoner at Pavia, a correspondence in prose
and in verse was carried on between him and
the countess. It still exists in the Imperial
Library, numbered 7688, and corrections are
traceable in the handwriting of the king; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
when the monarch was restored to liberty and
to France, on the 10th March 1526, another
beauty captivated his imagination, and the reign
of the Countess of Chateaubriand was at an end.</p>

<p>From the date of the imprisonment of Francis
I. Brantôme, Gaillard, and other historians
shew that the countess lived on good terms
with her husband, and that she accompanied
him of her own accord to Chateaubriand,
where the count falling dangerously ill, he
deemed it expedient to make some settlement
for the future maintenance of his wife. Towards
the end, then, of the year 1526 he drew
up a deed before a notary, in virtue of which
she became entitled to 4000 livres a year independently
of the castle. This act on the
part of the count proves that his wife was
pardoned; for it is, to say the least, unusual
to begin by providing for and enriching those
whom we intend to assassinate.</p>

<p>Hévin, the lawyer, avers, that in 1532, the
countess herself superintended the erection
of additional buildings at the castle of Chateaubriand.
Brantôme, whose authorities are
generally trustworthy, affirms that she was
at court in 1533, and present at the interview
between Francis I. and Pope Clement VII. at
Marseilles: and J. Bouchet, in his <i>Annales
d’Aquitaine</i>, even relates a remarkable anecdote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
connected with that meeting, in which the
Countess of Chateaubriand plays a part. Lastly,
a proof exists of her presence at the marriage
of her brother Lautrec’s daughter in 1535.</p>

<p>One strong objection that still remains to
be mentioned against the truth of the murder
of the Countess, is this. Among the popular
ballads of Brittany so carefully and scrupulously
collected by M. Hersart de la Villemarqué,
there is not one wherein we find the slightest
allusion to this dramatic story.</p>

<p><i>Les lettres inédites de la Reine de Navarre</i>
quoted by M. de Lescure in his <i>Amours de
François I.</i>, contain a document that is quite
conclusive in refuting the statements of Varillas;
a document which M. de Lescure was
the first to discover.</p>

<p>It is a letter written by Marguerite de Navarre
to her royal brother a few days after
the death of the Countess of Chateaubriand, October
1537. She died at the residence of her
husband, who was very ill himself at the time
and likely apparently, to follow speedily to the
grave the wife whom he was accused of having
murdered. The following is a translation of
a part of this remarkable epistle: “I have also
Monseigneur, seen M. de Chateaubriand, who
has been so near death that he is scarcely
to be recognised. He expresses much regret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
at the loss of his wife; your goodness to him
however, and the satisfaction he felt in seeing
me, have gone far to console him.”</p>

<p>M. de Chateaubriand, the renowned author
of Réné, Atala, &amp;c., makes some interesting
remarks on this subject in his <i>Mémoires d’Outretombe</i>.
He disbelieves the tragical death of his
relative, and thinks that Varillas has confounded
the actual adventures of Gilles de
Bretagne, the husband of Françoise de Chateaubriand,
with those of Françoise de Foix.
Gilles was confined in a dungeon by order of
his brother, Francis Duke of Brittany, at the
instigation of a favourite, Arthur de Montauban,
who was madly in love with Françoise,
the wife of Gilles. On the 24th April 1450,
the husband was strangled in his prison, and
his widow married the Count of Laval. We
perceive, that although the dates differ, there
is a similarity in the names and circumstances
of these two stories, Varillas having only
changed the sex of his victim and substituted
the wife for the murdered husband.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Paul Lacroix, in his <i>Curiosités
de l’Histoire de France</i>, does not yield to our
view of the argument, but is still disposed to
coincide with Varillas. Didot, in his <i>Biographie
Universelle</i>, also supports the same hypothesis;
but we attribute their persistence and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
of many others, to the influence exercised over
their imagination by the production of two
popular novels.</p>

<p>Pierre de Lescouvel, a Breton author, wrote
a novel on this supposed assassination, which
went through four or five editions and was at
first attributed to the Countess Murat, who
had gained some reputation as an authoress
at the court of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Madame de Lussan also founded a romance
on this tragical event, under the title of
<i>Anecdotes de la Cour de François I.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c10">CHARLES V. OF SPAIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1540.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">Notwithstanding</span> the information afforded by
the latest writers on the closing years of the
life of Charles V., which were passed in the
convent of Yuste,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the history of that monarch
by Robertson and by other authors who have
adopted his views, is still received by many
as unimpeachable authority. According to
these, Charles V., after his abdication, retired
to the convent of St. Yuste, in Estramadura,
where he adopted the habit of a monk, withdrew
from all interference in the government
of his vast empire, occupied himself wholly
with mechanism and the construction of clocks
and watches, and at length, when his mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
had become weakened and worn out, personally
rehearsed his own funeral. All this
is in fact nothing but a tissue of errors,
clearly disproved by existing authentic documents.
The love of the marvellous, however,
always inherent in the human mind, has
fostered the adoption of this romance, to the
exclusion of truth and veracity.</p>

<p>The name even of the monastery has been
transformed. Sancho Martin, a Spanish gentleman,
presented a small piece of land to some
monks in 1408; a convent was built upon it
which was called Yuste, from a small stream
of that name that trickled down the rocks and
watered the garden of the monks. It is this
stream, the Yuste, that merged its cognomen,
even in Spain, into St. Juste or Justo, leading
one to suppose that the monastery was dedicated
to a saint of that name.</p>

<p>Charles V. did not live with the monks, as
is commonly asserted; he never wore the habit
of the order; and he never ceased to wield
the imperial sceptre <i>de facto</i> and to control
the affairs of the state. He had, moreover, a
residence built for himself, detached from the
convent but communicating by passages with
the cloister and the church.</p>

<p>Except in Titian’s portrait the Emperor
was never seen in the habit of St. Jerome.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
He always retained his secular dress, which
was a single black doublet, exchanged during
periods of illness and <i>déshabille</i>, for rich wadded
silk dressing-gowns, of which he possessed no
less than sixteen in his wardrobe, if we may
believe the inventory made after his death.
In his letters to intimate correspondents we
continually find the following observation: “I
shall never become a monk, notwithstanding
my respect for the children of St. Jérome.”</p>

<p>Far from adopting an appearance of poverty,
or limiting his attendants to twelve in number,
as Sandoval and Robertson have asserted,
the household of the Emperor consisted of
more than fifty individuals, the chief of
whom was the major-domo, Luis Quijada.
Their annual salaries amounted to above
10,000 florins, equal to £. 4,400 of the present
day.</p>

<p>The profusion of plate taken by the Emperor
to the monastery was employed generally
for the wants of the establishment, and
for his personal use. The dishes and ornaments
of his table, the accessories of his
dressing-table, which betokened the <i>recherché</i>
nature of his toilet, the vases, ewers, basins,
and bottles of every shape and size in his
chamber, utensils of all sorts for his kitchen,
his cellar, his pantry and his medicine chest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
were made of solid silver, and weighed upwards
of 1,500 marks.</p>

<p>All these details, which are derived from
authentic documents in the archives of Simancas,
bring Charles V. before us in his convent
of Yuste in a very different light from that
in which we have usually seen him. Neither
must we picture to ourselves the convent in
Estramadura as the gloomy and solitary residence
it had been up to this time. It now
became a centre of life and action. Couriers
were continually arriving and departing. Every
fresh event was immediately reported to the
Emperor, whose opinion and whose commands
were received and acted upon in all important
matters. He was the umpire in every
dispute, and all candidates for favours applied
to him. In spite of the gout with which he
was continually afflicted, he spent whole hours
in reading despatches; in fact he was almost
as much immersed in public affairs in his
retreat, as he had been while actually on the
throne. Although he had delegated all official
authority, he retained the habit of command,
and was emperor to the last.</p>

<p>Another error propagated by Robertson
and several subsequent writers is, that the
intellect of Charles V. deteriorated until he
became a mere second-rate amateur of clocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
and watches, and that Torriano, who held the
title of watchmaker to the Emperor, worked
with his master at the trade. The truth is,
that Charles V. had a great natural taste for
the exact sciences, which is corroborated by
the variety of mathematical instruments enumerated
in the inventory of his effects taken
after his death. Torriano, far from being a
mere clockmaker, was a first-rate engineer
and mathematician, and was called by the
historian Strada the Archimedes of his age.
His mechanical inventions gained him a reputation
for sorcery among the monks of
Yuste. With regard to the reported collection
of clocks, we only find mention of four or
five in the long inventory. The Emperor was
a very exact observer of time, but no contemporary
writer has authorised us to suppose
that he took especial pleasure in amassing a
variety of watches and time-pieces.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Let us now examine the account given by
Sandoval and Robertson of the famous funeral
ceremony of the 31st August 1558. The
Scotch historian, with a sublime indifference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
to facts, informs us that Charles V., in the
last six months of his life, fell into the lowest
depths of superstition. He describes him as
seeking no other society but that of the monks;
as continually occupied in singing hymns with
them from the missal; as inflicting on himself
the discipline of the scourge, and lastly, as
desiring to rehearse his own obsequies. A desire
which could only have originated in an enfeebled
and diseased brain. Such are the events
contained in the introduction to Robertson’s
romance. He goes on to say that: “The
chapel was hung with black, and the blaze
of hundreds of waxlights was scarcely sufficient
to dispel the darkness. The brethren,
in their conventual dress, and all the Emperor’s
household clad in deep mourning,
gathered round a huge catafalque shrouded also
in black, which had been raised in the centre
of the chapel. The service for the burial of
the dead was then performed, and was accompanied
by the dismal wail of the monks’
prayers interceding for the departed soul, that
it might be received into the mansion of the
blessed. The sorrowing attendants were melted
to tears at this representation of their master’s
death, or they were touched, it may
be, with compassion by this pitiable display
of his weakness. Charles, muffled in a dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
mantle, and bearing a lighted candle in his
hand, mingled with his household, the spectator
of his own obsequies; and the doleful
ceremony was concluded by his placing the
taper in the hands of the priest in sign of
his surrendering up his soul to the Almighty.”</p>

<p>Such is the account given by Robertson,
and it has been still further embellished by
later writers. Not only have they represented
Charles V. as assisting at his own funeral,
but they have extended him in his coffin
like a corpse. In that position he is reported
to have joined the monks in chanting the
prayers for the dead. Another writer (Count
Victor Duhamel, <i>Histoire constitutionelle de la
Monarchie Espagnole</i>) goes still further: “After
the service,” says he, “they left the emperor
alone in the church. He then arose like a
spectre out of his bier, wrapped in a winding-sheet,
and prostrated himself at the foot of
the altar. This ceremony was succeeded by
fearful delirium caused by an attack of fever.
The Emperor,” he continues, “at length regained
his cell, where he expired the following
morning.”</p>

<p>Here the horrible and the absurd seem to
vie with one another. But these descriptions
are in complete contradiction with the strength
of mind really displayed by Charles V. in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
last moments; and are moreover contrary to
his character, his habits, and mode of life, and
with his sentiments as a man and as a Christian
on the solemnity of death, and the gravity of
the burial service. His dependants, who never
left his side, and who have transmitted the
minutest details of his life, would surely have
been cognizant of these imputed eccentricities,
and would doubtless have alluded to them.
But their testimony, on the contrary, contradicts
everything told by the monks, and
their records differ materially in regard to
dates.</p>

<p>In the first place, how can we give credence
to the ceremony itself?—a ceremony reserved
only for the dead by the Roman-catholic
church, and never performed for the living?
A council held at Toulouse in the beginning
of the 14th century pronounced, that the
church considered an anticipated funeral to
be an act of censurable superstition, and prohibited
any priest under pain of excommunication,
from taking part in it. This circumstance
would perhaps be insufficient to cast
a doubt upon the obsequies of Charles V., if
it stood alone, but it is supported by others.
The greater number of the incidents related
by the monks are improbable or false. The
Hieronymite chroniclers allege that Charles V.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
expended on this ceremony two thousand crowns
which he had saved up. Now a forcible objection
arises to the employment of so enormous
a sum for so simple a service. Only a
very small part of it could have been used
in obsequies which were without pomp and
needed scarcely any outlay. It is more probable,
on the contrary, as Sandoval affirms
(<i>Vida del Emperador Carlos V. en Yuste</i>), that
it was from this sum that the expenses of
the real funeral were drawn, the solemn services
of which lasted nine days. Moreover,
the physical strength of the Emperor, which
was on the wane, could not have borne the
fatigue of any such mock display. On the
15th August he was carried to the church,
and received the sacrament sitting. It was
only on the 24th that he was free from gout:
the eruption on his legs succeeded the gout:
and he was quite unfit to present himself
before the altar on the 29th. On the 31st
August, the day that has been selected for
these obsequies, he was confined for twenty
hours to his room by illness. If all these
impossibilities and improbabilities do not settle
the question, it remains to be explained why
neither the major-domo, nor the Emperor’s
secretary, nor his physician, who mention in
their letters all the ordinary incidents of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
religious life, especially when they bear some
reference to the state of his health, do not
speak of so extraordinary a ceremonial?—why,
remembering the funeral service of the Empress
on the anniversary of the 1st May, they
make no mention of the sham funeral that
the emperor had devised for himself?—why,
after stating that he had been carried to
church on the 15th of August, where he received
the sacrament sitting, they are entirely
silent respecting the absurd obsequies of the
31st, to which their master would undoubtedly
have summoned them, and which were so
immediately followed by his death? But they
are even more than silent, they indirectly
deny all the alleged circumstances. Their narrative
is at complete variance with that of
the monks.</p>

<p>About two o’clock on the morning of the
21st September 1558, the Emperor perceived
that his life was slowly ebbing away and that
death was near. Feeling his own pulse, he
shook his head as much as to say: “It is all
over.” He then begged the monks, says Quijada,
in a letter to Vasquez of the 21st September,
to recite the litanies by his bedside,
and the prayers for the dying. The archbishop,
at his request, gave him the crucifix
which had been embraced by the empress in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
her last hours; he carried it to his lips, pressed
it twice to his breast and said: “The moment
has come!” Shortly after he again pronounced
the name of Jesus and expired breathing two
or three sighs.</p>

<p>“So passed away,” wrote Quijada, with mingled
grief and admiration, “the greatest man that
ever was or ever will be.” The inconsolable
major-domo adds: “I cannot persuade myself
that he is dead.” And he continually entered
the chamber of his master, fell on his knees by
his bedside, and with many tears kissed over
and over again his cold inanimate hands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c11">THE INVENTOR OF THE<br> STEAM-ENGINE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1625.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> biography of Salomon de Caus and the
account of his labours and his discoveries
were scarcely known until the year 1828, when
a learned French scholar, Arago, published for
the first time in <i>L’Annuaire du Bureau des
Longitudes</i>, a remarkable article upon the history
of the steam-engine.</p>

<p>In it he cites the work of Salomon de Caus
entitled <i>Les raisons des forces mouvantes avec
diverses machines, &amp;c.</i>, which was first published
at Frankfort in 1615 and reprinted at
Paris in 1624. M. Arago draws from it the
conclusion that De Caus was the original inventor
of the steam-engine. Six years later
there appeared in the <i>Musée des Familles</i>, a
letter from the celebrated Marion Delorme,
supposed to have been written on the 3rd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
February 1641 to her lover Cinq-Mars. It
is as follows:</p>

<p>“My dear d’Effiat,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Whilst you are forgetting
me at Narbonne and giving yourself up to
the pleasures of the court and the delight
of thwarting the cardinal, I, pursuant to the
wishes you have expressed, am doing the
honours to your English lord, the Marquis
of Worcester, and I am taking him, or rather
he is taking me, from sight to sight, always
choosing the dullest and the saddest; speaking
little, listening with great attention, and fixing
upon those whom he questions two large blue
eyes which seem to penetrate to the very
depths of their understanding. Moreover, he
is never satisfied with the explanations that
are given him, and scarcely ever sees things
from the point of view in which they are
represented. As an instance of this I will
mention the visit we made together to Bicêtre,
where he thinks he has discovered in a maniac
a man of genius. If the man were not raging
mad I really believe that your Marquis would
have demanded his freedom, that he might
take him with him to London and listen to
his ravings from morning till night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“As we were crossing the court-yard of the
asylum, I more dead than alive from fright,
a hideous face appeared behind the large
grating and began to call out in a crazy
voice. ‘I am not mad; I have made a great
discovery that will enrich any country that
will carry it out.’ ‘What is this discovery?’
said I to the person who was shewing us over
the asylum. ‘Ah!’ said he, shrugging his
shoulders, ‘it is something very simple, but
you would never guess it. It is the employment
of the steam of boiling water.’ At this
I burst out laughing. ‘This man,’ resumed
the warder, ‘is called Salomon de Caus. He
came from Normandy four years ago to present
a memoir to the king upon the marvellous
effects that might be produced from his
invention. To listen to him, you might make
use of steam to move a theatre, to propel
carriages, and in fact to perform endless miracles.’
The Cardinal dismissed this fool
without giving him a hearing. Salomon de
Caus, not at all discouraged, took upon himself
to follow my lord cardinal everywhere,
who, tired of finding him incessantly at his
heels, and importuned by his follies, ordered
him to Bicêtre, where he has been confined
for three years and a half, and where, as you
have just heard, he cries out to every visitor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
that he is not mad, and that he has made a
wonderful discovery. He has even written a
book on this subject which is in my possession.’</p>

<p>“My Lord Worcester, who all this time appeared
to be in deep thought, asked to see
the book, and after having read a few pages,
said, ‘This man is not mad, and in my country,
instead of being shut up in a lunatic asylum
he would be laden with wealth. Take me to
him, I wish to question him. He was conducted
to his cell, but came back looking
grave and sad. ‘Now he is quite mad,’ said
he, ‘it is you who have made him so; misfortune
and confinement have completely destroyed
his reason; but when you put him
into that cell you enclosed in it the greatest
genius of your epoch.’ Thereupon we took
our leave, and since then he speaks of no one
but Salomon de Caus.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Adieu my dear and
loyal Henry; return soon, and do not be so
happy where you are, as to forget that a little
love must be left for me. Marion Delorme.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>The success obtained by this fictitious letter
was immense and lasting. The anecdote became
very popular, and was copied into
standard works, represented in engravings,
chased on silver goblets, &amp;c. At length some
incredulous critics examined more closely into
the matter, and found that not only had Salomon
de Caus never been confined in a
lunatic asylum, but that he had held the
appointment of engineer and architect to
Louis XIII. up to the time of his death, in
1630, while Marion Delorme is asserted to
have visited Bicêtre in 1641!!</p>

<p>On tracing this hoax to its source, we find
that M. Henri Berthoud, a literary man of
some repute and a constant contributor to
the <i>Musée des Familles</i>, confesses that the letter
imputed to Marion, was in fact written
by himself. The editor of this journal had
requested <i>Gavarni</i> to furnish him with a
drawing for a tale in which a madman was
introduced looking through the bars of his
cell. The drawing was executed and engraved,
but arrived too late; and the tale,
which could not wait, appeared without the
illustration. However, as the wood-engraving
was effective, and moreover was paid for, the
editor was unwilling that it should be useless.
Berthoud was therefore commissioned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
look for a subject and to invent a story to
which the engraving might be applied.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the world refused to believe
in M. Berthoud’s confession, so great a
hold had the anecdote taken on the public
mind; and a Paris newspaper went so far
even as to declare that the original autograph
of this letter was to be seen in a library in
Normandy! M. Berthoud wrote again denying
its existence, and offered a million of francs
to any one who would produce the said letter.</p>

<p>From that time the affair was no more spoken
of, and Salomon de Caus was allowed to remain
in undisputed possession of his fame as having
been the first to point out the use of steam
in his work <i>Les raisons des forces mouvantes</i>.
He had previously been employed as engineer
to Henry Prince of Wales,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> son of James I.,
and he published in London a folio volume,
“<i>La perspective, avec les raisons des ombres et
miroirs</i>.”</p>

<p>In his dedication of another work to the
queen of England in 1614, we find some
allusion made to the construction of hydraulic
machines. On his return to France he, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
we said before, was appointed engineer to
Louis XIII., and was doubtless encouraged by
Cardinal Richelieu, that great patron of arts
and letters.</p>

<p>In the castle of Heidelberg we find another
instance of the difficulty that exists in uprooting
an historical error. There is in the
<i>Galerie des Antiquités</i> of this castle a portrait
on wood of Salomon de Caus. Above this
portrait is exhibited a folio volume of this
author, the <i>Hortus Palatinus, Francofurti</i> 1620,
apud Joh. Theod. de Bry, with plates. A manuscript
note that accompanies this volume,
mentions that the letter of Marion Delorme
describing the madman of Bicêtre was extracted
from the <i>Gazette de France</i> of 3rd
March 1834.</p>

<p>Is it not singular that Heidelberg still remains
in ignorance of the truth respecting
this absurd story, and that the extract from
the <i>Gazette de France</i> is still permitted to
mislead the public?</p>

<p>As recently also as the 30th September
1865, at a banquet given at Limoges, M. le
Vicomte de la Guéronnière, a senator and a
man of letters, who presided, made a speech
which was reproduced in the <i>Moniteur</i> and
in which he repeats the anecdote of Salomon
de Caus and Bicêtre. The newspaper <i>L’Intermédiaire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></i>,
in its 45th number, of the 10th
November 1865, designates this persistence in
error as inept and stupid.</p>

<p>The works of de Caus were held in high
estimation among learned men during the
whole of the 17th century. He had however
been anticipated in the discovery of the application
of the power of steam for propelling
large bodies.</p>

<p>On the 17th of April 1543, the Spaniard
Don Blasco de Garay, launched a steam-vessel
at Barcelona in the presence of the Emperor
Charles V. It was an old ship of 200 tons
called <i>La sanctissima Trinidada</i>, which had been
fitted up for the experiment, and which moved
at the rate of ten miles an hour. The inventor
of this first steam-vessel was looked
upon as a mere enthusiast whose imagination
had run wild, and his only encouragement
was a donation of 200,000 marevedis from
his sovereign. The Emperor Charles no more
dreamt of using a discovery which at that
time would have placed the whole of Europe
at his feet, than did Napoleon I., three centuries
later, when the ingenious Fulton suggested
to him the application of steam to
navigation. It is well known that Fulton
was not even permitted to make an essay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
of this new propelling force in presence of the
French Emperor.</p>

<p>So then we must date the fact of the introduction
of steam navigation as far back as
1543; anterior to Salomon de Caus in 1615,
to the Marquis of Worcester in 1663, to
captain Savary in 1693, to Dr. Papin in 1696,
and to Fulton and others, who all lay claim
to the original idea.</p>

<p>But we may be wrong after all in denying
originality to these men, for we have no proof
that either of them had any knowledge of
the discoveries of his predecessors.</p>

<p>It was not until the 18th of March 1816,
that the first steam-vessel appeared in France,
making her entrance into the seaport of
Havre. She was the Eliza, which had left
Newhaven in England on the previous day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c12">GALILEO GALILEI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c large"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1630.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">There</span> are few celebrated men about whom
more has been written than Galileo.</p>

<p>The mere enumeration of the works of
which he is the subject would fill many pages:
nevertheless an important mistake relative to
one of the principal events of his life has
been so generally accepted and believed, that
it may be said to have passed almost into a
proverb, and many historians and scientific
writers have carelessly adopted and propagated
the error.</p>

<p>Between the years 1570 and 1670 Italy had
fallen into a state of torpor. The Italians, including
even the magnates of the land, had lost
all dignity and self-respect, and lay cringing
and prostrate at the feet of papal authority.
During this period of mental depression Galileo
came into the world. Although endowed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
a capacious and liberal mind, he was wanting
in strength of character, the great failing of
his countrymen and of the age in which he
lived. Never was he known to exclaim “<i>E
pur si muove!</i>” Never did he display the heroic
firmness that is falsely attributed to him.
Greatly in advance of his epoch in science,
he still belonged to it in all its shortcomings
and defects. He yielded, he hesitated, he drew
back before opposition, and was sometimes
induced to deny his own doctrines through
timidity or in the hope of disarming his
enemies, and of escaping from the storm and
the whirlwind he had raised around him.</p>

<p>The whole of his correspondence proves the
weakness of his character. In Italy, at the beginning
of the seventeenth century, the most
dangerous accusations that could be brought
against any man were deism and infidelity.
To doubt was punished with death. Galileo
was so imprudent as to address a long letter
to Castelli, in which he sought to reconcile the
words of scripture with the rotation of the
earth as discovered by Copernicus. Copernicus
had proved the fact previous to Galileo,
but he had used the wise precaution to give
his opinion only as an hypothesis, and in his
work on the motion of the heavenly bodies, dedicated
to Pope Paul III., he avoided wounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
any susceptibilities, taking especial care to
separate theology from science.</p>

<p>Galileo went even further in a second letter,
in which he not only attempted to reconcile
his principles of astronomy with scripture, but
he endeavoured to make the words of scripture
subservient to the axioms he laid down. Some
powerful friends tried to bring him to a sense
of his indiscretion. Cardinal Bellarmini sent
him a written remonstrance, urging him to
confine himself to mathematics and astronomy,
and to avoid the field of theology.</p>

<p>Monsignor Dini, the friend of Galileo, wrote
to him thus, 2nd May 1615: “Theologians allow
mathematical discussion, but only when the
subject is treated as a simple hypothesis, which
is alleged to have been the case with Copernicus.
The same liberty will be accorded to
you if you keep clear of theology.” Cardinal
Barberini, also on terms of friendship with
Galileo, sent word to him by Ciampoli on the
28th February of the same year, “that he
was not to pass the physical and mathematical
limits of the question, because the theologians
maintain that it appertains to them
alone to elucidate scripture.” They all advised
him openly and explicitly to refrain from
quoting the bible, and his pertinacity might
have excited admiration had it been based<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
on firmness of character, but his timidity and
innumerable self-contradictions when directly
accused of heresy gave the lie to his apparent
determination and adhesion to his
principles. When Cardinal Maffeo Barberini
was elected pope, under the name of Urbanus,
Galileo, who had long been on terms of
friendship with him, went to Rome to offer
his congratulations, and soon after published
his celebrated work: <i>Dialogo intorno ai due
massimi sistemi del mondo</i>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, instead of limiting himself
to astronomy in this work, he enters again
upon questions of theology utterly irrelevant
to the main subject; but, strangely enough, in
the preface to the <i>Dialogo</i> he has the weakness
to disguise his real opinions. “I come,” says
he, “to defend the system of Ptolemy. As
the friend of the cardinals who have condemned
the doctrines of Copernicus, I highly
approve their decision; a most excellent decision;
a most salutary decision. They who
have murmured against it, have been to blame.
If I take up my pen it is out of excess of
catholic zeal; this it is that moves me to
reappear before the public after many years
of silence.”</p>

<p>The reader cannot but feel compassion in
observing so much feeble-mindedness, unworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
of so great a genius. It may be said in his
excuse that the counsels of his best friends
forced him to play the miserable part with
which he has been reproached, that of servile
submission and the abandonment of his convictions.
While expressing the liveliest interest
in his works, his principal patron, the ambassador
of Tuscany, thus advises him in letters
of the 16th February and 9th April 1633:
“Submit yourself to whatever may be demanded
of you, as the only means of appeasing the
rancour of him who in the excess of his anger
has made this persecution a personal affair.
Never mind your convictions, do not defend
them, but conform to all that your enemies
may assert on the question of the earth’s
movement.”</p>

<p>Galileo was ordered to Rome to explain
himself before the tribunal of the Inquisition.
After remaining a month in the palace of the
ambassador of Tuscany, he was removed to
the palace of the Inquisition, but so far from
being imprisoned there, he himself informs
one of his friends that he has the use of
three spacious apartments, and the services of
his own servant, and that he can roam at
pleasure through the whole building. On the
12th April 1633 Galileo underwent his first
examination. He declares that in his dialogue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
upon the systems of the world, he neither
maintains nor defends the opinion of the mobility
of the earth and the immobility of the
sun; that he even demonstrates the contrary
opinion, shewing that the arguments of Copernicus
are without weight, and are inconclusive.
On his second examination, on the
30th April, he says plainly: “I do not actually
entertain the opinion of the movement of the
earth and the immobility of the sun; I will
add to my <i>Dialogo</i> two or three colloquies,
and I promise to take up one by one the
arguments in favour of the assertions which
you condemn, and to refute them unanswerably.”</p>

<p>Certainly the humiliation this great man
underwent was profound. He had carried
submission so far as to renounce the strongest
convictions of the man of science. His persecutors
were culpable and cruel, but our business
here is only to examine carefully and
truthfully the two following propositions: Was
Galileo thrown into the dungeons of the
Inquisition? and Was he subjected to torture?</p>

<p>A valuable opportunity has been lost of
clearing up the doubts which surround the
trial of Galileo. In 1809 all the original documents
relating to this suit were transmitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
from Rome to Paris with the papal archives,
and it was intended to publish the whole in
the form of a volume consisting of seven or
eight hundred pages. Delambre, the historian
of modern astronomy, while sending several
extracts from these deeds to Venturi, one of
Galileo’s biographers, attributes the oblivion
into which this intention was suffered to fall,
entirely to political motives. Delambre informs
us, moreover, that in 1820 the original
deeds were no longer forthcoming. Monsignor
Morrini, who had been commissioned
to claim from the French government whatever
appertained to the Holy See, endeavoured
in vain to obtain the papers relating to the
trial of Galileo. At length the manuscript was
restored to Gregory XVI., it was not known
how, or by whom, and it was deposited by
Pius IX., in 1848, in the archives of the Vatican;
since which date no full details have
been published. It is now, however, positively
affirmed that Galileo was never thrown
into the dungeons of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>After the second examination to which Galileo
was subjected, Cardinal Barberini suffered
him to return to his apartments at the embassy
of the grand Duke of Tuscany, where
the ambassador Nicolini, his family and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
household, continued to treat him with much
affectionate consideration.</p>

<p>He was again summoned before the Inquisition
on the 10th May and on the 21st June,
when he repeated that he held as true and
indisputable the opinion of Ptolemy, that is
to say the immobility of the earth and the
mobility of the sun. This was the close of
the trial. The next day, Wednesday, 22nd June,
1633, he was brought before the cardinals and
prelates of the congregation to hear his sentence
and to make his recantation.</p>

<p>It was in the church of the convent of St.
Minerva that Galileo Galilei, aged seventy years,
pronounced on his knees a form of recantation.
It has been said that Galileo, on rising
from his knees, murmured these words: “<i>E
pure si muove!</i>” No doubt this protestation
of truth against falsehood may at this cruel
crisis have rushed from his heart to his lips,
but it must be remembered that if these
words had actually been heard, his relapse
would have infallibly led him to the stake.</p>

<p>Monsieur Biot, in a learned and conscientious
biographical notice, has clearly pointed
out, that Galileo was not subjected to torture
during any part of his trial anterior to the
22nd June 1633. M. Libri, in his <i>Histoire des
sciences mathématiques en Italie</i>, is of opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
that as Galileo was subjected to <i>a rigorous
examination</i>, according to the wording of the
sentence, it might be logically inferred that
torture had really been inflicted on him.</p>

<p>But Monsignor Marini has fully proved that
the <i>rigorous examination</i> was an enquiry which
did not necessarily include torture. M. Philarète
Chasles, in his <i>Essay on Galileo</i> (the best
compendium that we have on the life, labours,
and persecutions of the learned Italian astronomer),
shews that the popular story, or rather
fable, of the persecution of Galileo, accepted by
the vulgar, is based upon a false document, a
letter forged by the Duc Caetani and his librarian,
and addressed to Reineri, and which
Tiraboschi, a dupe to the fraud, inserted in
his <i>Histoire littéraire d’Italie</i>. This letter was
taken as an authority, and M. Libri, in his
remarkable work “<i>Histoire des sciences mathématiques
en Italie</i>,” cites it in support of his
opinion. But this apocryphal letter is rejected
by Nelli, Reumont, and all accurate critics.
If Galileo was really subjected to torture, how
can we account for the circumstance that
during his life-time no rumour of it was
current?—that his pupils, his partisans, his
numerous defenders, knew nothing of it in
France, in Holland, or in Germany?</p>

<p>A few days after his recantation, Galileo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
Galilei returned to Sienna to his friend the
Archbishop Piccolomini, in whose palace the
Pope desired him to remain. The following
letter was written soon after his arrival at
Sienna: “At the entreaty of the ambassador
Nicolini, the Pope has granted me permission
to reside in the palace and the garden of the
Medici on the Trinità, and instead of a prison
the archiepiscopal palace has been assigned
to me as a home, in which I have already
spent fifteen days, congratulating myself on
the ineffable kindness of the Archbishop.”</p>

<p>On the 1st December the Pope issued a
decree by which Galileo received permission
to occupy his villa d’Arcetri, which had been
in his possession since 1631. This villa, where
Milton visited him, and where Galileo died,
on the 8th January 1642, at nearly seventy-eight
years of age, is situated on a declivity
of one of the hills that overlook Florence.
An inscription still perpetuates the memory
of its illustrious proprietor. It was here,
under arrest, and pending the good will and
pleasure of the Pope, that Galileo expiated his
imaginary crime. On the 28th July 1640 he
wrote to Deodati: “My definitive prison is this
little villa, situated a mile from Florence. I
am forbidden to receive the visits of my
friends, or to invite them to come and converse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
with me. My life is very tranquil. I
often go to the neighbouring convent of <i>San
Matteo</i>, where two of my daughters are nuns.
I love them both dearly, especially the elder,
who unites extraordinary intellectual powers
to much goodness of heart.”</p>

<p>The growing infirmities of age now began
to tell upon Galileo. His weary eyes refused
to serve him, and he became completely blind.
He was tended in his solitude by his two
daughters from the convent. One of them
was taken from him by death, but she was
replaced by other affectionate relatives, who
endeavoured to amuse and console the lonely
captive. His letters breathe a poetical melancholy,
a quiet irony, an overwhelming humility
and an overpowering sense of weariness.</p>

<p>Those who wish to form a just idea of this
great and persecuted man, of his true character,
his labours, his foibles, and his lack of
moral courage, should read the <i>Beiträge zur
italienischen Geschichte</i>, by Alfred von Reumont,
envoy of his Majesty the King of Prussia at
Florence. He has classified the correspondence
of Galileo and that of his friends, and has completed
the labours and researches of Fabroni,
Nelli, Venturi, Libri, Marini, Biot, &amp;c. Dr.
Max Parchoppe has also very recently sifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
and weighed in a remarkable manner, all the
evidence relating to the life of Galileo.</p>

<p>We will conclude by mentioning a circumstance
very little known and with which the
public have only recently become acquainted
through an unpublished letter of Galileo dated
in the second year of his retreat. It exhibits
this illustrious scholar in a new light, as an
amateur of good wine and good cheer. “I
desire,” he says, “that you should take the
advice of the most experienced judges, and
procure for me with all diligence and with all
imaginable care, a provision of forty bottles,
or two cases of liqueurs of various kinds and
of the most exquisite quality. You need not
consider the expense: I am so moderate in all
other sensual indulgences that I may allow myself
some scope in favour of Bacchus without
fear of giving offence to Venus or to Ceres.
You will, I think, easily find wines of Scillo
and of Carini (Scylla and Charybdis if you
prefer to call them so)—Greek wines from the
country of my master, Archimedes the Syracusian;
Claret wines, &amp;c. When you send me
the cases, be so good as to enclose the account,
which I will pay scrupulously and
quickly, &amp;c. From my prison of Arcetri,
4th March.” “<i>Con ogni diligenza e col consiglio
et intervento dei piu purgati gusti, voglio restar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
serviti di farmi provisione di 40 fiaschi, cioè
di due casse di liquori varii esquisiti che costi
si ritrovino, non curando punto di rispiarme
dispesa, perche rispiarmo tanto in tutti gl’altri
gusti corporali che posso lasciarmi andare a
qualche cosa a richiesta di Bacco, senza offesa
delle sue compagne Venere e Cerere. Costi non
debbon mancare Scillo e Carini (onde voglio dire
Scilla e Caribdi) nè meno la patria del mio
maestro Archimede Siracusano, i Grecchi, e
Claretti, &amp;c. Havranno, come spero, comodo di
farmegli capitare col ritorno delle casse della
dispensa, ed io prontamente sodisfaro tutta la
spesa, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="c"><i>Dalla mia carcere d’Arcetri, 4 di Marzo.</i></p>

<p class="r">
<i>Galileo Galiᵉⁱ.</i>”
</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that he designates
his pretty villa at Arcetri as his prison;
probably because he was forbidden to extend
his walks beyond the convent of San Matteo.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> In a report of the meeting of the Academy of
Sciences in Paris, May 1857, M. le Baron Dupin, the
spokesman of the Academy, informed the public “that
Omar, Mahomet’s general, having conquered the valley
of the Nile, his lieutenant Amrou suggested to him the
formation of a canal direct from Suez to Pelusium; but,”
continues Monsieur Dupin, “was it likely that the man
(Amrou) who was guilty of burning the Alexandrian library,
should possess sufficient capacity to carry out so grand
an idea.”</p>

<p>Now there are here almost as many errors as words.
First, the Emir Omar never did conquer the valley of
the Nile. Secondly, he could not have rejected the idea
of the construction of a canal from Suez to Pelusium, for
the very good reason that the canal already existed; and
lastly, he did not burn the Ptolomean library of Alexandria,
as it had been destroyed two centuries and a half previously.</p>
